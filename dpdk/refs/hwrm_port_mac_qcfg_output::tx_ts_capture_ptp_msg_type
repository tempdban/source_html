	 * This is a 16-bit bit mask that represents the
	 * current configuration of time stamp capture of PTP messages
	 * on the transmit side of this port.
	 * If bit &apos;i&apos; is set, then the transmit side of the port
	 * is configured to capture the time stamp of every
	 * received PTP message with messageType field value set
	 * to i.
	 * If all bits are set to 0 (i.e. field value set 0),
	 * then the transmit side of the port is not configured
	 * to capture timestamp for PTP messages.
	 * If all bits are set to 1, then the transmit side of the
	 * port is configured to capture timestamp for all PTP
	 * messages.
