 * t4_wait_op_done_val - wait until an operation is completed
 * @adapter: the adapter performing the operation
 * @reg: the register to check for completion
 * @mask: a single-bit field within @reg that indicates completion
 * @polarity: the value of the field when the operation is completed
 * @attempts: number of check iterations
 * @delay: delay in usecs between iterations
 * @valp: where to store the value of the register at completion time
 *
 * Wait until an operation is completed by checking a bit in a register
 * up to @attempts times.  If @valp is not NULL the value of the register
 * at the time it indicated completion is stored there.  Returns 0 if the
 * operation completes and -EAGAIN otherwise.
