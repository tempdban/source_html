	 * Priority setting for tunnel VLAN PRI to CoS mapping.
	 * # Each XXX_pri variable shall have a unique priority value
	 * when it is being used.
	 * # When comparing priorities of mappings, higher value
	 * indicates higher priority.
	 * For example, a value of 0-3 is returned where 0 is being
	 * the lowest priority and 3 is being the highest priority.
	 * # If the correspoding CoS mapping is not enabled, then this
	 * field should be ignored.
	 * # This value indicates the normalized priority value retained
