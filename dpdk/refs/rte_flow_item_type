 * Matching pattern item types.
 *
 * Pattern items fall in two categories:
 *
 * - Matching protocol headers and packet data, usually associated with a
 *   specification structure. These must be stacked in the same order as the
 *   protocol layers to match inside packets, starting from the lowest.
 *
 * - Matching meta-data or affecting pattern processing, often without a
 *   specification structure. Since they do not match packet contents, their
 *   position in the list is usually not relevant.
 *
 * See the description of individual types for more information. Those
 * marked with [META] fall into the second category.
