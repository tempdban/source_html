<doc f='master/drivers/bus/dpaa/include/fsl_qman.h' l='1520'>/**
 * qman_create_fq - Allocates a FQ
 * @fqid: the index of the FQD to encapsulate, must be &quot;Out of Service&quot;
 * @flags: bit-mask of QMAN_FQ_FLAG_*** options
 * @fq: memory for storing the &apos;fq&apos;, with callbacks filled in
 *
 * Creates a frame queue object for the given @fqid, unless the
 * QMAN_FQ_FLAG_DYNAMIC_FQID flag is set in @flags, in which case a FQID is
 * dynamically allocated (or the function fails if none are available). Once
 * created, the caller should not touch the memory at &apos;fq&apos; except as extended to
 * adjacent memory for user-defined fields (see the definition of &quot;struct
 * qman_fq&quot; for more info). NO_MODIFY is only intended for enqueuing to
 * pre-existing frame-queues that aren&apos;t to be otherwise interfered with, it
 * prevents all other modifications to the frame queue. The TO_DCPORTAL flag
 * causes the driver to honour any contextB modifications requested in the
 * qm_init_fq() API, as this indicates the frame queue will be consumed by a
 * direct-connect portal (PME, CAAM, or Fman). When frame queues are consumed by
 * software portals, the contextB field is controlled by the driver and can&apos;t be
 * modified by the caller. If the AS_IS flag is specified, management commands
 * will be used on portal @p to query state for frame queue @fqid and construct
 * a frame queue object based on that, rather than assuming/requiring that it be
 * Out of Service.
