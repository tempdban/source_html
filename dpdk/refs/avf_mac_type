 * The structures of function pointers are filled out at init time when we
 * know for sure exactly which hardware we&apos;re working with.  This gives us the
 * flexibility of using the same main driver code but adapting to slightly
 * different hardware needs as new parts are developed.  For this architecture,
 * the Firmware and AdminQ are intended to insulate the driver from most of the
 * future changes, but these structures will also do part of the job.
