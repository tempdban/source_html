 * @warning

 * Crypto event metadata structure will be filled by application
 * to provide crypto request and event response information.
 *
 * If crypto events are enqueued using a HW mechanism, the cryptodev
 * PMD will use the event response information to set up the event
 * that is enqueued back to eventdev after completion of the crypto
 * operation. If the transfer is done by SW, event response information
 * will be used by the adapter.
