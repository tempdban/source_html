 * struct dpni_taildrop - Structure representing the taildrop
 * @enable:	Indicates whether the taildrop is active or not.
 * @units:	Indicates the unit of THRESHOLD. Queue taildrop only
 *		supports byte units, this field is ignored and
 *		assumed = 0 if CONGESTION_POINT is 0.
 * @threshold:	Threshold value, in units identified by UNITS field. Value 0
 *		cannot be used as a valid taildrop threshold,
 *		THRESHOLD must be &gt; 0 if the taildrop is
 *		enabled.
 * @oal	:	Overhead Accounting Length, a 12-bit, 2&apos;s complement value
 *		with range (-2048 to +2047) representing a fixed per-frame
 *		overhead to be added to the actual length of a frame when
 *		performing WRED and tail drop calculations and threshold
 *		comparisons.
