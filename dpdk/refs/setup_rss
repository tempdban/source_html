 * setup_rss - configure RSS
 * @adapter: the adapter
 *
 * Sets up RSS to distribute packets to multiple receive queues.  We
 * configure the RSS CPU lookup table to distribute to the number of HW
 * receive queues, and the response queue lookup table to narrow that
 * down to the response queues actually configured for each port.
 * We always configure the RSS mapping for all ports since the mapping
 * table has plenty of entries.
