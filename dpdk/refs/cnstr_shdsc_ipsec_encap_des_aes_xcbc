 * cnstr_shdsc_ipsec_encap_des_aes_xcbc - IPSec DES-CBC/3DES-CBC and
 *     AES-XCBC-MAC-96 ESP encapsulation shared descriptor.
 * @descbuf: pointer to buffer used for descriptor construction
 * @pdb: pointer to the PDB to be used with this descriptor
 *       This structure will be copied inline to the descriptor under
 *       construction. No error checking will be made. Refer to the
 *       block guide for a details of the encapsulation PDB.
 * @cipherdata: pointer to block cipher transform definitions
 *              Valid algorithm values - OP_PCL_IPSEC_DES, OP_PCL_IPSEC_3DES.
 * @authdata: pointer to authentication transform definitions
 *            Valid algorithm value: OP_PCL_IPSEC_AES_XCBC_MAC_96.
 *
 * Supported only for platforms with 32-bit address pointers and SEC ERA 4 or
 * higher. The tunnel/transport mode of the IPsec ESP is supported only if the
 * Outer/Transport IP Header is present in the encapsulation output packet.
 * The descriptor performs DES-CBC/3DES-CBC &amp; HMAC-MD5-96 and then rereads
 * the input packet to do the AES-XCBC-MAC-96 calculation and to overwrite
 * the MD5 ICV.
 * The descriptor uses all the benefits of the built-in protocol by computing
 * the IPsec ESP with a hardware supported algorithms combination
 * (DES-CBC/3DES-CBC &amp; HMAC-MD5-96). The HMAC-MD5 authentication algorithm
 * was chosen in order to speed up the computational time for this intermediate
 * step.
 * Warning: The user must allocate at least 32 bytes for the authentication key
 * (in order to use it also with HMAC-MD5-96),even when using a shorter key
 * for the AES-XCBC-MAC-96.
 *
 * Return: size of descriptor written in words or negative number on error
