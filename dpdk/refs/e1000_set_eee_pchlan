 *  e1000_set_eee_pchlan - Enable/disable EEE support
 *  @hw: pointer to the HW structure
 *
 *  Enable/disable EEE based on setting in dev_spec structure, the duplex of
 *  the link and the EEE capabilities of the link partner.  The LPI Control
 *  register bits will remain set only if/when link is up.
 *
 *  EEE LPI must not be asserted earlier than one second after link is up.
 *  On 82579, EEE LPI should not be enabled until such time otherwise there
 *  can be link issues with some switches.  Other devices can have EEE LPI
 *  enabled immediately upon link up since they have a timer in hardware which
 *  prevents LPI from being asserted too early.
