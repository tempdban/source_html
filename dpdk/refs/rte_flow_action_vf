 * Directs matching traffic to a given virtual function of the current

 * Packets matched by a VF pattern item can be redirected to their original
 * VF ID instead of the specified one. This parameter may not be available
 * and is not guaranteed to work properly if the VF part is matched by a
 * prior flow rule or if packets are not addressed to a VF in the first
