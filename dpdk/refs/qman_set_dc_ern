 * qman_set_dc_ern - Set the handler for DCP enqueue rejection notifications
 * @handler: callback for processing DCP ERNs
 * @affine: whether this handler is specific to the locally affine portal
 *
 * If a hardware block&apos;s interface to Qman (ie. its direct-connect portal, or
 * DCP) is configured not to receive enqueue rejections, then any enqueues
 * through that DCP that are rejected will be sent to a given software portal.
 * If @affine is non-zero, then this handler will only be used for DCP ERNs
 * received on the portal affine to the current CPU. If multiple CPUs share a
 * portal and they all call this function, they will be setting the handler for
 * the same portal! If @affine is zero, then this handler will be global to all
 * portals handled by this instance of the driver. Only those portals that do
 * not have their own affine handler will use the global handler.
