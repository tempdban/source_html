 * This object is normally allocated by applications and set by PMDs, the
 * message points to a constant string which does not need to be freed by
 * the application, however its pointer can be considered valid only as long
 * as its associated DPDK port remains configured. Closing the underlying
 * device or unloading the PMD invalidates it.

 * Both cause and message may be NULL regardless of the error type.
