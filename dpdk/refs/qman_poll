 * qman_poll
 *
 * Dispatcher logic on a cpu can use this to trigger any maintenance of the
 * affine portal. There are two classes of portal processing in question;
 * fast-path (which involves demuxing dequeue ring (DQRR) entries and tracking
 * enqueue ring (EQCR) consumption), and slow-path (which involves EQCR
 * thresholds, congestion state changes, etc). This function does whatever
 * processing is not triggered by interrupts.
 *
 * Note, if DQRR and some slow-path processing are poll-driven (rather than
 * interrupt-driven) then this function uses a heuristic to determine how often
 * to run slow-path processing - as slow-path processing introduces at least a
 * minimum latency each time it is run, whereas fast-path (DQRR) processing is
 * close to zero-cost if there is no work to be done.
