<doc f='dpdk_1805/drivers/net/i40e/base/virtchnl.h' l='600'>/* VF reset states - these are written into the RSTAT register:
 * VFGEN_RSTAT on the VF
 * When the PF initiates a reset, it writes 0
 * When the reset is complete, it writes 1
 * When the PF detects that the VF has recovered, it writes 2
 * VF checks this register periodically to determine if a reset has occurred,
 * then polls it to know when the reset is complete.
 * If either the PF or VF reads the register while the hardware
 * is in a reset state, it will return DEADBEEF, which, when masked
 * will result in 3.
