 * Before processing a batch of entries, a stage must first claim them to get
 * access. This function is threadsafe using same opdl_stage parameter if
 * the stage was created with threadsafe set to true, otherwise it is only
 * threadsafe with a different opdl_stage per thread.
 *
 * The difference between this function and opdl_stage_claim() is that this
 * function copies the entries from the opdl_ring. Note that any changes made to
 * the copied entries will not be reflected back in to the entries in the
 * opdl_ring, so this function probably only makes sense if the entries are
 * pointers to other data. For performance reasons, this function does not check
 * input parameters.
 *
 * @param s
 *   The opdl_ring stage to read entries in.
 * @param entries
 *   An array of entries that will be filled in by this function.
 * @param num_entries
 *   The number of entries to attempt to claim for processing (and the size of
 *   the entries array).
 * @param seq
 *   If not NULL, this is set to the value of the internal stage sequence number
 *   associated with the first entry returned.
 * @param block
 *   If this is true, the function blocks until num_entries slots are available
 *   to process. If false, then the function claims as many entries as
 *   currently possible.
 *
 * @return
 *   The number of entries copied in to the entries array.
