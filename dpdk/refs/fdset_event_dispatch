 * This functions runs in infinite blocking loop until there is no fd in
 * pfdset. It calls corresponding r/w handler if there is event on the fd.
 *
 * Before the callback is called, we set the flag to busy status; If other
 * thread(now rte_vhost_driver_unregister) calls fdset_del concurrently, it
 * will wait until the flag is reset to zero(which indicates the callback is
 * finished), then it could free the context after fdset_del.
