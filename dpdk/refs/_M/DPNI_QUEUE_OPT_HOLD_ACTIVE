 * Set the queue to hold active mode.  This prevents the queue from being
 * rescheduled between DPIOs while it carries traffic and is active on one
 * DPNI.  Can help reduce reordering when servicing one queue on multiple
 * CPUs, but the queue is also less likely to push data to multiple CPUs
 * especially when congested.
