<doc f='dpdk_1805/drivers/net/fm10k/base/fm10k_type.h' l='312'>/* When fist initialized, VFs need to know the Interrupt Throttle Rate (ITR)
 * scale which is based on the PCIe speed but the speed information in the PCI
 * configuration space may not be accurate. The PF already knows the ITR scale
 * but there is no defined method to pass that information from the PF to the
 * VF. This is accomplished during VF initialization by temporarily co-opting
 * the yet-to-be-used TDLEN register to have the PF store the ITR shift for
 * the VF to retrieve before the VF needs to use the TDLEN register for its
 * intended purpose, i.e. before the Tx resources are allocated.
