	 * If set to 1,  the device will treat this packet with LSO(Large
	 * Send Offload) processing for both normal or encapsulated
	 * packets, which is a form of TCP segmentation.  When this bit
	 * is 1, the hdr_size and mss fields must be valid. The driver
	 * doesn&apos;t need to set t_ip_chksum, ip_chksum, and tcp_udp_chksum
