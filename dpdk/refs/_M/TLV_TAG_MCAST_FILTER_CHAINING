<doc f='dpdk_1805/drivers/net/sfc/base/ef10_tlv_layout.h' l='718'>/* Multicast filter chaining mode selection.
 *
 * When enabled, multicast packets are delivered to all recipients of all
 * matching multicast filters, with the exception that IP multicast filters
 * will steal traffic from MAC multicast filters on a per-function basis.
 * (New behaviour.)
 *
 * When disabled, multicast packets will always be delivered only to the
 * recipients of the highest priority matching multicast filter.
 * (Legacy behaviour.)
 *
 * The DEFAULT mode (which is the same as the tag not being present at all)
 * is equivalent to ENABLED in production builds, and DISABLED in eftest
 * builds.
 *
 * This option is intended to provide run-time control over this feature
 * while it is being stabilised and may be withdrawn at some point in the
 * future; the new behaviour is intended to become the standard behaviour.
