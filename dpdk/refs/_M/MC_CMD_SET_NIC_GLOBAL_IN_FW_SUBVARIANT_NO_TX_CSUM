 * of not supporting any TX checksum offloads. Only supported when running some
 * f/w variants, others will return ENOTSUP (as reported by the homonymous bit
 * in MC_CMD_GET_CAPABILITIES_V2). Can only be set when no other drivers are
 * attached, and the calling driver must have no resources allocated. See the
 * DPDK section of the EF10 Driver Writers Guide for a more detailed
