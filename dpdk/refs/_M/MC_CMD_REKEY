 * This request causes the NIC to generate a new per-NIC key and program it
 * into the write-once memory. During the process all flash partitions that are
 * protected with a CMAC are verified with the old per-NIC key and then signed
 * with the new per-NIC key. If the NIC has already reached its rekey limit the
 * REKEY op will return MC_CMD_ERR_ERANGE. The REKEY op may block until
 * completion or it may return 0 and continue processing, therefore the caller
 * must poll at least once to confirm that the rekeying has completed. The POLL
 * operation returns MC_CMD_ERR_EBUSY if the rekey process is still running
 * otherwise it will return the result of the last completed rekey operation,
 * or 0 if there has not been a previous rekey.
