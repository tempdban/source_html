<doc f='master/drivers/net/sfc/base/efx_regs_mcdi.h' l='15954'>/* enum: Opcode associated with the propagation of a private key that TSAN uses
 * as part of post-binding authentication procedure. More specifically, TSAN
 * uses this key for a signing operation. TSAC uses the counterpart public key
 * to verify the signature. Note - The post-binding authentication occurs when
 * the TSAN-TSAC connection terminates and TSAN tries to reconnect. Refer to
 * SF-114946-SW for more information. This sub-command is only available over a
 * TLS secure connection between the TSAN and TSAC.
