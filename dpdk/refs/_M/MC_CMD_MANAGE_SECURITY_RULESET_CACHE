 * Manage the persistent NVRAM cache of security rules created with
 * MC_CMD_SET_SECURITY_RULE. Note that the cache is not automatically updated
 * as rules are added or removed; the active ruleset must be explicitly
 * committed to the cache. The cache may also be explicitly invalidated,
 * without affecting the currently active ruleset. When the cache is valid, it
 * will be loaded at power on or MC reboot, instead of the default ruleset.
 * Rollback of the currently active ruleset to the cached version (when it is
 * valid) is also supported. (Medford-only; for use by SolarSecure apps, not
 * directly by drivers. See SF-114946-SW.) NOTE - The only sub-operation
 * allowed in an adapter bound to a TSA controller from the local host is
 * OP_GET_CACHED_VERSION. All other sub-operations are prohibited.
