 * Calculate the address of the next transition for
 * all types of nodes. Note that only DFA nodes and range
 * nodes actually transition to another node. Match
 * nodes not supposed to be encountered here.
 * For quad range nodes:
 * Calculate number of range boundaries that are less than the
 * input value. Range boundaries for each node are in signed 8 bit,
 * ordered from -128 to 127.
 * This is effectively a popcnt of bytes that are greater than the
 * input byte.
 * Single nodes are processed in the same ways as quad range nodes.
