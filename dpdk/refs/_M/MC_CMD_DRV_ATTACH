 * Inform MCPU that this port is managed on the host (i.e. driver active). For
 * Huntington, also request the preferred datapath firmware to use if possible

 * issue a subsequent MC_CMD_GET_CAPABILITIES command to determine which
 * features are actually available). The FIRMWARE_ID field is ignored by older
