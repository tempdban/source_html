 * This feature cannot be turned on/off while there are any filters already
 * present. The behaviour in such case depends on the acting client&apos;s privilege
 * level. If the client has the admin privilege, then all functions that have
 * filters installed will be FLRed and the FLR_DONE flag will be set. Otherwise
 * the command will fail with MC_CMD_ERR_FILTERS_PRESENT.
