 * Reuse spare address to contain the offset from the start of
 * the host buffer where the first byte of the received frame
 * will land.  Any metadata will come prior to that offset.  If the
 * value in this field is 0, it means that that the metadata will
 * always land starting at the first byte of the host buffer and
 * packet data will immediately follow the metadata.  As always,
 * the RX descriptor indicates the presence or absence of metadata
 * along with the length thereof.
