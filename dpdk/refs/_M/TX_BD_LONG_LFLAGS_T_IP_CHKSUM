	 * If set to 1, The controller replaces the tunnel IP checksum
	 * field with hardware calculated IP checksum for the IP header
	 * of the packet associated with this descriptor.
	 *
	 * For outer UDP checksum, global outer UDP checksum TE_NIC register
	 * needs to be enabled. If the global outer UDP checksum TE_NIC register
	 * bit is set, outer UDP checksum will be calculated for the following
	 * cases:
	 * 1. Packets with tcp_udp_chksum flag set to offload checksum for inner
	 * packet AND the inner packet is TCP/UDP. If the inner packet is ICMP for
	 * example (non-TCP/UDP), even if the tcp_udp_chksum is set, the outer UDP
	 * checksum will not be calculated.
	 * 2. Packets with lso flag set which implies inner TCP checksum calculation
	 * as part of LSO operation.
