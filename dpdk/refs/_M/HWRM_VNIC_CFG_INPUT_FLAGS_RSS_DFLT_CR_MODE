	 * When a VNIC uses one destination ring group for certain
	 * application (e.g. Receive Flow Steering) where
	 * exact match is used to direct packets to a VNIC with one
	 * destination ring group only, there is no need to configure
	 * RSS indirection table for that VNIC as only one destination
	 * ring group is used.
	 *
	 * This flag is used to enable a mode where
	 * RSS is enabled in the VNIC using a RSS context
	 * for computing RSS hash but the RSS indirection table is
	 * not configured using hwrm_vnic_rss_cfg.
	 *
	 * If this mode is enabled, then the driver should not program
	 * RSS indirection table for the RSS context that is used for
	 * computing RSS hash only.
