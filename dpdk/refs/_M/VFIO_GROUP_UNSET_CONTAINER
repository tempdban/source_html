 * VFIO_GROUP_UNSET_CONTAINER - _IO(VFIO_TYPE, VFIO_BASE + 5)
 *
 * Remove the group from the attached container.  This is the
 * opposite of the SET_CONTAINER call and returns the group to
 * an initial state.  All device file descriptors must be released
 * prior to calling this interface.  When removing the last group
 * from a container, the IOMMU will be disabled and all state lost,
 * effectively also returning the VFIO file descriptor to an initial
 * state.
 * Return: 0 on success, -errno on failure.
 * Availability: When attached to container
