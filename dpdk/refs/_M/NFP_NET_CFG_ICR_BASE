 * Interrupt Control/Cause registers (0x0c00 - 0x0d00)
 * These registers are only used when MSI-X auto-masking is not
 * enabled (@NFP_NET_CFG_CTRL_MSIXAUTO not set).  The array is index
 * by MSI-X entry and are 1B in size.  If an entry is zero, the
 * corresponding entry is enabled.  If the FW generates an interrupt,
 * it writes a cause into the corresponding field.  This also masks
 * the MSI-X entry and the host driver must clear the register to
 * re-enable the interrupt.
