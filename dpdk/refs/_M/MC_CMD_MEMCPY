 * DMA write data into (Rid,Addr), either by dma reading (Rid,Addr), or by data
 * embedded directly in the command.
 *
 * A common pattern is for a client to use generation counts to signal a dma
 * update of a datastructure. To facilitate this, this MCDI operation can
 * contain multiple requests which are executed in strict order. Requests take
 * the form of duplicating the entire MCDI request continuously (including the
 * requests record, which is ignored in all but the first structure)
 *
 * The source data can either come from a DMA from the host, or it can be
 * embedded within the request directly, thereby eliminating a DMA read. To
 * indicate this, the client sets FROM_RID=%RID_INLINE, ADDR_HI=0, and
 * ADDR_LO=offset, and inserts the data at %offset from the start of the
 * payload. It&apos;s the callers responsibility to ensure that the embedded data
 * doesn&apos;t overlap the records.
 *
 * Returns: 0, EINVAL (invalid RID)
