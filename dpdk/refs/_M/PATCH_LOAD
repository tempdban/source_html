 * PATCH_LOAD - Auxiliary command to resolve self referential code
 * @program: buffer to be updated (struct program *)
 * @line: position in descriptor buffer where the update will be done; this
 *        value is previously retained in program flow using a reference near
 *        the sequence to be modified.
 * @new_ref: updated value that will be inserted in descriptor buffer at the
 *          specified line; this value is previously obtained using SET_LABEL
 *          macro near the line that will be used as reference (unsigned int).
 *          For LOAD command, the value represents the offset field (in words).
 *
 * Return: 0 in case of success, a negative error code if it fails
