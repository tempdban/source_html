<doc f='master/drivers/net/sfc/base/efx_regs_mcdi.h' l='4256'>/* enum: GENERATION_END value, used together with GENERATION_START to verify
 * consistency of DMAd data. For legacy firmware / drivers without extended
 * stats (more precisely, when DMA_LEN == MC_CMD_MAC_NSTATS *
 * sizeof(uint64_t)), this entry holds the GENERATION_END value. Otherwise,
 * this value is invalid/ reserved and GENERATION_END is written as the last
 * 64-bit word of the DMA buffer (at DMA_LEN - sizeof(uint64_t)). Note that
 * this is consistent with the legacy behaviour, in the sense that entry 96 is
 * the last 64-bit word in the buffer when DMA_LEN == MC_CMD_MAC_NSTATS *
 * sizeof(uint64_t). See SF-109306-TC, Section 9.2 for details.
