	 * # If the packet is identified as TCP/IPv6, then the
	 * packet is split at the beginning of the TCP payload.
	 * # If the packet is identified as UDP/IPv6, then the
	 * packet is split at the beginning of UDP payload.
	 * # If the packet is identified as non-TCP and non-UDP
	 * IPv6 packet, then the packet is split at the beginning
	 * of the upper layer protocol header carried in the IPv6
	 * packet.
