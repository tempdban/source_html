 * are subtle, and so downloads must proceed in a number of phases.
 *
 * 1) PHASE_RESET with a target of TARGET_ALL and chunk ID/length of 0.
 *
 * 2) PHASE_IMEMS for each of the IMEM targets (target IDs 0-11). Each download
 * may consist of multiple chunks. The final chunk (with CHUNK_ID_LAST) should
 * be a checksum (a simple 32-bit sum) of the transferred data. An individual
 * download may be aborted using CHUNK_ID_ABORT.
 *
 * 3) PHASE_VECTORS for each of the vector table targets (target IDs 12-15),
 * similar to PHASE_IMEMS.
 *
 * 4) PHASE_READY with a target of TARGET_ALL and chunk ID/length of 0.
 *
 * After any error (a requested abort is not considered to be an error) the
 * sequence must be restarted from PHASE_RESET.
