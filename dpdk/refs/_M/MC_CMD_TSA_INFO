 * Messages sent from TSA adapter to TSA controller. This command is only valid
 * when the MCDI header has MESSAGE_TYPE set to MCDI_MESSAGE_TYPE_TSA. This
 * command is not sent by the driver to the MC; it is sent from the MC to a TSA
 * controller, being treated more like an alert message rather than a command;
 * hence the MC does not expect a response in return. Doxbox reference
