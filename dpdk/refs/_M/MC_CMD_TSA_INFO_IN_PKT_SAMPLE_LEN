 *
 * It is desireable for the TSA controller to learn the traffic pattern of
 * packets seen at the network port being monitored. In order to learn about
 * the traffic pattern, the TSA controller may want to sample packets seen at
 * the network port. Based on the packet samples that the TSA controller
 * receives from the adapter, the controller may choose to configure additional
 * black-list or white-list rules to allow or block packets as required.
 *
 * Although the entire sampled packet as seen on the network port is available
 * to the MC the length of sampled packet sent to controller is restricted by
 * MCDI payload size. Besides, the TSA controller does not require the entire
 * packet to make decisions about filter updates. Hence the packet sample being
 * passed to the controller is truncated to 128 bytes. This length is large
 * enough to hold the ethernet header, IP header and maximum length of
 * supported L4 protocol headers (IPv4 only, but can hold IPv6 header too, if
 * required in future).
 *
 * The intention is that any future changes to this message format that are not
 * backwards compatible will be defined with a new operation code.
