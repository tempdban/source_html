 * VF posts its version number to the PF. PF responds with its version number
 * in the same format, along with a return code.
 * Reply from PF has its major/minor versions also in param0 and param1.
 * If there is a major version mismatch, then the VF cannot operate.
 * If there is a minor version mismatch, then the VF can operate but should
 * add a warning to the system log.
 *
 * This enum element MUST always be specified as == 1, regardless of other
 * changes in the API. The PF must always respond to this message without
 * error regardless of version mismatch.
