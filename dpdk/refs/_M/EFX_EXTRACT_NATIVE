 * Extract bit field portion [low,high) from the native-endian element
 * which contains bits [min,max).
 *
 * For example, suppose &quot;element&quot; represents the high 32 bits of a
 * 64-bit value, and we wish to extract the bits belonging to the bit
 * field occupying bits 28-45 of this 64-bit value.
 *
 * Then EFX_EXTRACT(_element, 32, 63, 28, 45) would give
 *
 *   (_element) &lt;&lt; 4
 *
 * The result will contain the relevant bits filled in in the range
 * [0,high-low), with garbage in bits [high-low+1,...).
