 * If a host driver does a HELLO and discovers that there&apos;s already a MASTER
 * selected, we may have to wait for that MASTER to finish issuing RESET,
 * configuration and INITIALIZE commands.  Also, there&apos;s a possibility that
 * our own HELLO may get lost if it happens right as the MASTER is issuign a
 * RESET command, so we need to be willing to make a few retries of our HELLO.
