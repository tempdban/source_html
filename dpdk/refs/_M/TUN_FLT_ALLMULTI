 * Filter spec (used for SETXXFILTER ioctls)
 * This stuff is applicable only to the TAP (Ethernet) devices.
 * If the count is zero the filter is disabled and the driver accepts
 * all packets (promisc mode).
 * If the filter is enabled in order to accept broadcast packets
 * broadcast addr must be explicitly included in the addr list.
