 * scheme (i.e. in more than one physical partition in NVRAM) the host can set
 * this to control which underlying physical partition is used to read data
 * from. This allows it to perform a read-modify-write-verify with the write
 * lock continuously held by calling NVRAM_UPDATE_START, reading the old
 * contents using MODE=TARGET_CURRENT, overwriting the old partition and then
 * verifying by reading with MODE=TARGET_BACKUP.
