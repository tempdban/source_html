 * Returns the current reading from each sensor. DMAs an array of sensor
 * readings, in order of sensor type (but without gaps for unimplemented
 * sensors), into host memory. Each array element is a
 * MC_CMD_SENSOR_VALUE_ENTRY_TYPEDEF dword.
 *
 * If the request does not contain the LENGTH field then only sensors 0 to 30
 * are reported, to avoid DMA buffer overflow in older host software. If the
 * sensor reading require more space than the LENGTH allows, then return
 * EINVAL.
 *
 * The MC will send a SENSOREVT event every time any sensor changes state. The
 * driver is responsible for ensuring that it doesn&apos;t miss any events. The
 * board will function normally if all sensors are in STATE_OK or
 * STATE_WARNING. Otherwise the board should not be expected to function.
