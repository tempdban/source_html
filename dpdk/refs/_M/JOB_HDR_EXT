 * JOB_HDR_EXT - Configures JOB Descriptor HEADER command
 * @program: pointer to struct program
 * @share: descriptor share state (enum rta_share_type)
 * @start_idx: index in descriptor buffer where the execution of the job
 *            descriptor should start (unsigned int). In case SHR bit is present
 *            in flags, this will be the shared descriptor length.
 * @share_desc: pointer to shared descriptor, in case SHR bit is set (uint64_t)
 * @flags: operational flags: RSMS, DNR, TD, MTD, REO, SHR
 * @ext_flags: extended header flags: DSV (DECO Select Valid), DECO Id (limited
 *             by DSEL_MASK).
 *
 * Return: On success, descriptor buffer offset where this command is inserted.
 *         On error, a negative error code; first error program counter will
 *         point to offset in descriptor buffer where the instruction should
 *         have been written.
