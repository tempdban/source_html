 * Check the CMAC of the contents of IMEM and DMEM against the value supplied
 * and if correct begin execution from the start of IMEM. The caller supplies a
 * key ID, the length of IMEM and DMEM to validate and the expected CMAC. CMAC
 * computation runs from the start of IMEM, and from the start of DMEM + 16k,
 * to match flash booting. The command will respond with EINVAL if the CMAC
 * does match, otherwise it will respond with success before it jumps to IMEM.
