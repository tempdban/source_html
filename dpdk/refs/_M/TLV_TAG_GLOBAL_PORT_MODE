<doc f='dpdk_1805/drivers/net/sfc/base/ef10_tlv_layout.h' l='532'>/* Dynamic port mode.
 *
 * Allows selecting alternate port configuration for platforms that support it
 * (e.g. 1x40G vs 2x10G on Milano, 1x40G vs 4x10G on Medford). This affects the
 * number of externally visible ports (and, hence, PF to port mapping), so must
 * be done at boot time.
 *
 * Port mode naming convention is
 *
 * [nports_on_cage0]x[port_lane_width]_[nports_on_cage1]x[port_lane_width]
 *
 * Port lane width determines the capabilities (speeds) of the ports, subject
 * to architecture capabilities (e.g. 25G support) and switch bandwidth
 * constraints:
 *  - single lane ports can do 25G/10G/1G
 *  - dual lane ports can do 50G/25G/10G/1G (with fallback to 1 lane)
 *  - quad lane ports can do 100G/40G/50G/25G/10G/1G (with fallback to 2 or 1 lanes)

 * This tag supercedes tlv_global_port_config.
