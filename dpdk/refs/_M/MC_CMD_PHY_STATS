 * Get generic PHY statistics. This call returns the statistics for a generic
 * PHY in a sparse array (indexed by the enumerate). Each value is represented
 * by a 32bit number. If the DMA_ADDR is 0, then no DMA is performed, and the
 * statistics may be read from the message response. If DMA_ADDR != 0, then the
 * statistics are dmad to that (page-aligned location). Locks required: None.
 * Returns: 0, ETIME
