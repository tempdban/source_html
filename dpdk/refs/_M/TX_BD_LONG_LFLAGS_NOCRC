	 * If set to 1, the controller will not append an Ethernet CRC
	 * to the end of the frame.
	 *
	 * This bit must be valid on the first BD of a packet.
	 *
	 * Packet must be 64B or longer when this flag is set.  It is not
	 * useful to use this bit with any form of TX offload such as
	 * CSO or LSO.  The intent is that the packet from the host already
	 * has a valid Ethernet CRC on the packet.
