<doc f='dpdk_1805/drivers/net/sfc/base/efx_regs_mcdi.h' l='12223'>/* Hash control flags. The _EN bits are always supported, but new modes are
 * available when ADDITIONAL_RSS_MODES is reported by MC_CMD_GET_CAPABILITIES:
 * in this case, the MODE fields may be set to non-zero values, and will take
 * effect regardless of the settings of the _EN flags. See the RSS_MODE
 * structure for the meaning of the mode bits. Drivers must check the
 * capability before trying to set any _MODE fields, as older firmware will
 * reject any attempt to set the FLAGS field to a value &gt; 0xff with EINVAL. In
 * the case where all the _MODE flags are zero, the _EN flags take effect,
 * providing backward compatibility for existing drivers. (Setting all _MODE
 * *and* all _EN flags to zero is valid, to disable RSS spreading for that
 * particular packet type.)
