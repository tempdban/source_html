 *
 * The TSA controller maintains a list of IP addresses valid for each port of a
 * TSA adapter. The TSA controller requires information from the adapter
 * inorder to learn new IP addresses assigned to a physical port and to
 * identify those that are no longer assigned to the physical port. For this
 * purpose, the TSA adapter snoops ARP replys, gratuitous ARP requests and ARP
 * probe packets seen on each physical port. This definition describes the
 * format of the notification message sent from a TSA adapter to a TSA
 * controller related to any information related to a change in IP address
 * assignment for a port. Doxbox reference SF-117371.
 *
 * There may be a possibility of combining multiple notifications in a single
 * message in future. When that happens, a new flag can be defined using the
 * reserved bits to describe the extended format of this notification.
