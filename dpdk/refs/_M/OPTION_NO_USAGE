   included in help messages).  This is mainly intended for options that are
   completely documented in an argp&apos;s ARGS_DOC field, in which case including
   the option in the generic usage list would be redundant.  For instance,
   if ARGS_DOC is &quot;FOO BAR\n-x BLAH&quot;, and the `-x&apos; option&apos;s purpose is to
   distinguish these two cases, -x should probably be marked
   OPTION_NO_USAGE.  */</doc>
