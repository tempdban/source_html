 * Flush receive queue(s). If SRIOV is enabled (via MC_CMD_SRIOV), then RXQ
 * flushes should be initiated via this MCDI operation, rather than via
 * directly writing FLUSH_CMD.
 *
 * The flush is completed (either done/fail) asynchronously (after this command
 * returns). The driver must still wait for flush done/failure events as usual.
