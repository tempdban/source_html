 * Currently there are two types of coalesce WR. Type 0 needs 48 bytes per
 * packet (if one sgl is present) and type 1 needs 32 bytes. This means
 * that type 0 can fit a maximum of 10 packets per WR and type 1 can fit
 * 15 packets. We need to keep track of the mbuf pointers in a coalesce WR
 * to be able to free those mbufs when we get completions back from the FW.
 * Allocating the maximum number of pointers in every tx desc is a waste
 * of memory resources so we only store 2 pointers per tx desc which should
 * be enough since a tx desc can only fit 2 packets in the best case
 * scenario where a packet needs 32 bytes.
