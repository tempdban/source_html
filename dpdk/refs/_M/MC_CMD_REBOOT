 * Reboot the MC.
 *
 * The AFTER_ASSERTION flag is intended to be used when the driver notices an
 * assertion failure (at which point it is expected to perform a complete tear
 * down and reinitialise), to allow both ports to reset the MC once in an
 * atomic fashion.
 *
 * Production mc firmwares are generally compiled with REBOOT_ON_ASSERT=1,
 * which means that they will automatically reboot out of the assertion
 * handler, so this is in practise an optional operation. It is still
 * recommended that drivers execute this to support custom firmwares with
 * REBOOT_ON_ASSERT=0.
 *
 * Locks required: NONE Returns: Nothing. You get back a response with ERR=1,
 * DATALEN=0
