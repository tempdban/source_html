 * helps to identify the host that an adapter is plugged into. This identifier
 * is ideally the system UUID retrieved and set by the UEFI driver. If the UEFI
 * driver is unable to extract the system UUID, it would still set a random
 * 16-byte value into each supported SF adapter plugged into it. Host UUIDs may
 * change if the system is power-cycled, however, they persist across adapter
 * resets. If the host UUID was not set on an adapter, due to an unsupported
 * version of UEFI driver, then this command returns an error. Doxbox reference
