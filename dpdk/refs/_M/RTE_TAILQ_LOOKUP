 * Utility macro to make looking up a tailqueue for a particular struct easier.
 *
 * @param name
 *   The name of tailq
 *
 * @param struct_name
 *   The name of the list type we are using. (Generally this is the same as the
 *   first parameter passed to TAILQ_HEAD macro)
 *
 * @return
 *   The return value from rte_eal_tailq_lookup, typecast to the appropriate
 *   structure pointer type.
 *   NULL on error, since the tailq_head is the first
 *   element in the rte_tailq_head structure.
