 * EFD_TARGET_GROUP_NUM_RULES:
 *   Adjusts how many groups/chunks are allocated at table creation time
 *   to support the requested number of rules. Higher values pack entries
 *   more tightly in memory, resulting in a smaller memory footprint
 *   for the online table.
 *   This comes at the cost of lower insert/update performance.
 *
 * EFD_MAX_GROUP_NUM_RULES:
 *   This adjusts the amount of offline memory allocated to store key/value
 *   pairs for the table. The recommended numbers are upper-bounds for
 *   this parameter
 *   - any higher and it becomes very unlikely that a perfect hash function
 *   can be found for that group size. This value should be at
 *   least 40% larger than EFD_TARGET_GROUP_NUM_RULES
 *
 * Recommended values for various lookuptable and hashfunc sizes are:
 *
 *   HASH_FUNC_SIZE = 16, LOOKUPTBL_SIZE = 16:
 *     EFD_TARGET_GROUP_NUM_RULES = 22
 *     EFD_MAX_GROUP_NUM_RULES = 28
