   FLAGS is one of the ARGP_ flags above.  If ARG_INDEX is non-NULL, the
   index in ARGV of the first unparsed option is returned in it.  If an
   unknown option is present, ARGP_ERR_UNKNOWN is returned; if some parser
   routine returned a non-zero value, it is returned; otherwise 0 is
   returned.  This function may also call exit unless the ARGP_NO_HELP flag
   is set.  INPUT is a pointer to a value to be passed in to the parser.  */</doc>
