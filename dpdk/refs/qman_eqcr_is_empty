 * qman_eqcr_is_empty - Determine if portal&apos;s EQCR is empty
 *
 * For use in situations where a cpu-affine caller needs to determine when all
 * enqueues for the local portal have been processed by Qman but can&apos;t use the
 * QMAN_ENQUEUE_FLAG_WAIT_SYNC flag to do this from the final qman_enqueue().
 * The function forces tracking of EQCR consumption (which normally doesn&apos;t
 * happen until enqueue processing needs to find space to put new enqueue
 * commands), and returns zero if the ring still has unprocessed entries,
 * non-zero if it is empty.
