 * The general idea of the bucket mempool driver is as follows.
 * We keep track of physically contiguous groups (buckets) of objects
 * of a certain size. Every such a group has a counter that is
 * incremented every time an object from that group is enqueued.
 * Until the bucket is full, no objects from it are eligible for allocation.
 * If a request is made to dequeue a multiply of bucket size, it is
 * satisfied by returning the whole buckets, instead of separate objects.
