 * Action handler packet drop
 *
 * This function is called by the pipeline action handlers (port in/out, table)
 * to drop the packets selected using packet mask.
 *
 * This function can be called by any input/output port or table action handler
 * to drop selected packets from the burst of packets read from one of the
 * pipeline input ports and currently processed by the pipeline. The dropped
 * packets are removed from any further pipeline processing and the packet
 * buffers are eventually freed to their buffer pool.
 *
 * This function updates the drop statistics counters correctly, therefore the
 * recommended approach for dropping packets by the action handlers is to call
 * this function as opposed to the action handler hijacking the packets first
 * and then dropping them invisibly to the pipeline (by using the
 * rte_pktmbuf_free() function).
 *
 * @param p
 *   Handle to pipeline instance
 * @param pkts_mask
 *   64-bit bitmask specifying which of the packets handed over for processing
 *   to the action handler is to be dropped by the action handler. When
 *   pkts_mask bit n is set, then element n of the pkts array (input argument to
 *   the action handler) is dropped.
 * @return
 *   0 on success, error code otherwise
