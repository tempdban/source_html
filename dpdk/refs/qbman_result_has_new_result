 * qbman_result_has_new_result() - Check and get the dequeue response from the
 * dq storage memory set in pull dequeue command
 * @s: the software portal object.
 * @dq: the dequeue result read from the memory.
 *
 * Only used for user-provided storage of dequeue results, not DQRR. For
 * efficiency purposes, the driver will perform any required endianness
 * conversion to ensure that the user&apos;s dequeue result storage is in host-endian
 * format (whether or not that is the same as the little-endian format that
 * hardware DMA&apos;d to the user&apos;s storage). As such, once the user has called
 * qbman_result_has_new_result() and been returned a valid dequeue result,
 * they should not call it again on the same memory location (except of course
 * if another dequeue command has been executed to produce a new result to that
 * location).
 *
 * Return 1 for getting a valid dequeue result, or 0 for not getting a valid
 * dequeue result.
