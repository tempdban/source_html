	 * This is the RSS hash type for the packet.  The value is packed
	 * {tuple_extrac_op[1:0],rss_profile_id[4:0],tuple_extrac_op[2]}.
	 *
	 * The value of tuple_extrac_op provides the information about
	 * what fields the hash was computed on.
	 * * 0: The RSS hash was computed over source IP address,
	 * destination IP address, source port, and destination port of inner
	 * IP and TCP or UDP headers. Note: For non-tunneled packets,
	 * the packet headers are considered inner packet headers for the RSS
	 * hash computation purpose.
	 * * 1: The RSS hash was computed over source IP address and destination
	 * IP address of inner IP header. Note: For non-tunneled packets,
	 * the packet headers are considered inner packet headers for the RSS
	 * hash computation purpose.
	 * * 2: The RSS hash was computed over source IP address,
	 * destination IP address, source port, and destination port of
	 * IP and TCP or UDP headers of outer tunnel headers.
	 * Note: For non-tunneled packets, this value is not applicable.
	 * * 3: The RSS hash was computed over source IP address and
	 * destination IP address of IP header of outer tunnel headers.
	 * Note: For non-tunneled packets, this value is not applicable.
	 *
	 * Note that 4-tuples values listed above are applicable
	 * for layer 4 protocols supported and enabled for RSS in the hardware,
	 * HWRM firmware, and drivers. For example, if RSS hash is supported and
	 * enabled for TCP traffic only, then the values of tuple_extract_op
	 * corresponding to 4-tuples are only valid for TCP traffic.
