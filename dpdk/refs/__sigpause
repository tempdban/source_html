<doc f='include/signal.h' l='161'>/* The `sigpause&apos; function has two different interfaces.  The original
   BSD definition defines the argument as a mask of the signal, while
   the more modern interface in X/Open defines it as the signal
   number.  We go with the BSD version unless the user explicitly
   selects the X/Open version.

   This function is a cancellation point and therefore not marked with
   __THROW.  */</doc>
