 *A DQRI interrupt can be generated when there are dequeue results on the
 * portal&apos;s DQRR (this mechanism does not deal with &quot;pull&quot; dequeues to
 * user-supplied &apos;storage&apos; addresses). There are two parameters to this
 * interrupt source, one is a threshold and the other is a timeout. The
 * interrupt will fire if either the fill-level of the ring exceeds &apos;thresh&apos;, or
 * if the ring has been non-empty for been longer than &apos;timeout&apos; nanoseconds.
 * For timeout, an approximation to the desired nanosecond-granularity value is
 * made, so there are get and set APIs to allow the user to see what actual
 * timeout is set (compared to the timeout that was requested).
