	 * Interrupt mask {0,1}
	 *
	 * For TX bufring, host set this to 1, when it is processing
	 * the TX bufring, so that we can safely skip the TX event
	 * notification to host.
	 *
	 * For RX bufring, once this is set to 1 by us, host will not
	 * further dispatch interrupts to us, even if there are data
	 * pending on the RX bufring.  This effectively disables the
	 * interrupt of the channel to which this RX bufring is attached.
