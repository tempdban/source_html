 * RTE_FLOW_ACTION_TYPE_SECURITY
 *
 * Perform the security action on flows matched by the pattern items
 * according to the configuration of the security session.
 *
 * This action modifies the payload of matched flows. For INLINE_CRYPTO, the
 * security protocol headers and IV are fully provided by the application as
 * specified in the flow pattern. The payload of matching packets is
 * encrypted on egress, and decrypted and authenticated on ingress.
 * For INLINE_PROTOCOL, the security protocol is fully offloaded to HW,
 * providing full encapsulation and decapsulation of packets in security
 * protocols. The flow pattern specifies both the outer security header fields
 * and the inner packet fields. The security session specified in the action
 * must match the pattern parameters.
 *
 * The security session specified in the action must be created on the same
 * port as the flow action that is being specified.
 *
 * The ingress/egress flow attribute should match that specified in the
 * security session if the security session supports the definition of the
 * direction.
 *
 * Multiple flows can be configured to use the same security session.
