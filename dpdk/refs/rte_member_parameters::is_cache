	 * is_cache is only used for HT based setsummary.
	 *
	 * If it is HT based setsummary, user to specify the subtype or mode
	 * of the setsummary. It could be cache, or non-cache mode.
	 * Set is_cache to be 1 if to use as cache mode.
	 *
	 * For cache mode, keys can be evicted out of the HT setsummary. Keys
	 * with the same signature and map to the same bucket
	 * will overwrite each other in the setsummary table.
	 * This mode is useful for the case that the set-summary only
	 * needs to keep record of the recently inserted keys. Both
	 * false-negative and false-positive could happen.
	 *
	 * For non-cache mode, keys cannot be evicted out of the cache. So for
	 * this mode the setsummary will become full eventually. Keys with the
	 * same signature but map to the same bucket will still occupy multiple
	 * entries. This mode does not give false-negative result.
