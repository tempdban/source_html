 * Delete items from the set-summary. Note that vBF does not support deletion
 * in current implementation. For vBF, error code of -EINVAL will be returned.

 * @param setsum
 *   Pointer to the set-summary.
 * @param key
 *   Pointer of the key to be deleted.
 * @param set_id
 *   For HT mode, we need both key and its corresponding set_id to
 *   properly delete the key. Without set_id, we may delete other keys with the
 *   same signature.
 * @return
 *   If no entry found to delete, an error code of -ENOENT could be returned.
