	 * @options: Any combination of the following options:
	 *		DPNI_OPT_TX_FRM_RELEASE
	 *		DPNI_OPT_NO_MAC_FILTER
	 *		DPNI_OPT_HAS_POLICING
	 *		DPNI_OPT_SHARED_CONGESTION
	 *		DPNI_OPT_HAS_KEY_MASKING
	 *		DPNI_OPT_NO_FS
	 * @fs_entries: Number of entries in the flow steering table.
	 *		This table is used to select the ingress queue for
	 *		ingress traffic, targeting a GPP core or another.
	 *		In addition it can be used to discard traffic that
	 *		matches the set rule. It is either an exact match table
	 *		or a TCAM table, depending on DPNI_OPT_ HAS_KEY_MASKING
	 *		bit in OPTIONS field. This field is ignored if
	 *		DPNI_OPT_NO_FS bit is set in OPTIONS field. Otherwise,
	 *		value 0 defaults to 64. Maximum supported value is 1024.
	 *		Note that the total number of entries is limited on the
	 *		SoC to as low as 512 entries if TCAM is used.
	 * @vlan_filter_entries: Number of entries in the VLAN address filtering
	 *		table. This is an exact match table used to filter
	 *		ingress traffic based on VLAN IDs. Value 0 disables VLAN
	 *		filtering. Maximum supported value is 16.
	 * @mac_filter_entries: Number of entries in the MAC address filtering
	 *		table. This is an exact match table and allows both
	 *		unicast and multicast entries. The primary MAC address
	 *		of the network interface is not part of this table,
	 *		this contains only entries in addition to it. This
	 *		field is ignored if DPNI_OPT_ NO_MAC_FILTER is set in
	 *		OPTIONS field. Otherwise, value 0 defaults to 80.
	 *		Maximum supported value is 80.
	 * @num_queues: Number of Tx and Rx queues used for traffic
	 *		distribution. This is orthogonal to QoS and is only
	 *		used to distribute traffic to multiple GPP cores.
	 *		This configuration affects the number of Tx queues
	 *		(logical FQs, all associated with a single CEETM queue),
	 *		Rx queues and Tx confirmation queues, if applicable.
	 *		Value 0 defaults to one queue. Maximum supported value
	 *		is 8.
	 * @num_tcs: Number of traffic classes (TCs), reserved for the DPNI.
	 *		TCs can have different priority levels for the purpose
	 *		of Tx scheduling (see DPNI_SET_TX_SELECTION), different
	 *		BPs (DPNI_ SET_POOLS), policers. There are dedicated QM
	 *		queues for traffic classes (including class queues on
	 *		Tx). Value 0 defaults to one TC. Maximum supported value
	 *		is 8.
	 * @qos_entries: Number of entries in the QoS classification table. This
	 *		table is used to select the TC for ingress traffic. It
	 *		is either an exact match or a TCAM table, depending on
	 *		DPNI_OPT_ HAS_KEY_MASKING bit in OPTIONS field. This
	 *		field is ignored if the DPNI has a single TC. Otherwise,
	 *		a value of 0 defaults to 64. Maximum supported value
	 *		is 64.
