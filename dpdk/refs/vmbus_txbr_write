 * Write scattered channel packet to TX bufring.
 *
 * The offset of this channel packet is written as a 64bits value
 * immediately after this channel packet.
 *
 * The write goes through three stages:
 *  1. Reserve space in ring buffer for the new data.
 *     Writer atomically moves priv_write_index.
 *  2. Copy the new data into the ring.
 *  3. Update the tail of the ring (visible to host) that indicates
 *     next read location. Writer updates write_index
