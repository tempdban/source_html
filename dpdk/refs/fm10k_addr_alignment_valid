 * Verify Rx packet buffer alignment is valid.
 *
 * Hardware requires specific alignment for Rx packet buffers. At
 * least one of the following two conditions must be satisfied.
 *  1. Address is 512B aligned
 *  2. Address is 8B aligned and buffer does not cross 4K boundary.
 *
 * Return 1 if buffer alignment satisfies at least one condition,
 * otherwise return 0.
 *
 * Note: Alignment is checked by the driver when the Rx queue is reset. It
 *       is assumed that if an entire descriptor ring can be filled with
 *       buffers containing valid alignment, then all buffers in that mempool
 *       have valid address alignment. It is the responsibility of the user
 *       to ensure all buffers have valid alignment, as it is the user who
 *       creates the mempool.
 * Note: It is assumed the buffer needs only to store a maximum size Ethernet
 *       frame.
