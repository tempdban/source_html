 * qbman_swp_fq_force() - Force the FQ to fully scheduled state.
 * @s: the software portal object.
 * @fqid: the index of frame queue to be forced.
 *
 * Force eligible will force a tentatively-scheduled FQ to be fully-scheduled
 * and thus be available for selection by any channel-dequeuing behaviour (push
 * or pull). If the FQ is subsequently &quot;dequeued&quot; from the channel and is still
 * empty at the time this happens, the resulting dq_entry will have no FD.
 * (qbman_result_DQ_fd() will return NULL.)
 *
 * Return 0 for success, or negative error code for failure.
