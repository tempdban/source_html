	 * A VQ shall not have an exclusive associated H/W queue.
	 * Rather a H/W Queue will be shared by multiple Virtual Queues.
	 * This mode will have intermediate data structures to support
	 * multi VQ to PQ mappings thus having some performance implications.
	 * Note: Even in this mode there is an option to allocate a H/W
	 * queue for a VQ. Please see &apos;RTE_QDMA_VQ_EXCLUSIVE_PQ&apos; flag.
