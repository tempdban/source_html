 * Insert given mbuf in reorder buffer in its correct position
 *
 * The given mbuf is to be reordered relative to other mbufs in the system.
 * The mbuf must contain a sequence number which is then used to place
 * the buffer in the correct position in the reorder buffer. Reordered
 * packets can later be taken from the buffer using the rte_reorder_drain()
 * API.
 *
 * @param b
 *   Reorder buffer where the mbuf has to be inserted.
 * @param mbuf
 *   mbuf of packet that needs to be inserted in reorder buffer.
 * @return
 *   0 on success
 *   -1 on error
 *   On error case, rte_errno will be set appropriately:
 *    - ENOSPC - Cannot move existing mbufs from reorder buffer to accommodate
 *      early mbuf, but it can be accommodated by performing drain and then insert.
 *    - ERANGE - Too early or late mbuf which is vastly out of range of expected
 *      window should be ignored without any handling.
