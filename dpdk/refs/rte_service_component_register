 * Register a new service.
 *
 * A service represents a component that the requires CPU time periodically to
 * achieve its purpose.
 *
 * For example the eventdev SW PMD requires CPU cycles to perform its
 * scheduling. This can be achieved by registering it as a service, and the
 * application can then assign CPU resources to that service.
 *
 * Note that when a service component registers itself, it is not permitted to
 * add or remove service-core threads, or modify lcore-to-service mappings. The
 * only API that may be called by the service-component is
 * *rte_service_component_runstate_set*, which indicates that the service
 * component is ready to be executed.
 *
 * @param spec The specification of the service to register
 * @param[out] service_id A pointer to a uint32_t, which will be filled in
 *             during registration of the service. It is set to the integers
 *             service number given to the service. This parameter may be NULL.
 * @retval 0 Successfully registered the service.
 *         -EINVAL Attempted to register an invalid service (eg, no callback
 *         set)
