 * A structure used to configure the Receive Side Scaling (RSS) feature
 * of an Ethernet port.
 * If not NULL, the *rss_key* pointer of the *rss_conf* structure points
 * to an array holding the RSS key to use for hashing specific header
 * fields of received packets. The length of this array should be indicated
 * by *rss_key_len* below. Otherwise, a default random hash key is used by
 * the device driver.
 *
 * The *rss_key_len* field of the *rss_conf* structure indicates the length
 * in bytes of the array pointed by *rss_key*. To be compatible, this length
 * will be checked in i40e only. Others assume 40 bytes to be used as before.
 *
 * The *rss_hf* field of the *rss_conf* structure indicates the different
 * types of IPv4/IPv6 packets to which the RSS hashing must be applied.
 * Supplying an *rss_hf* equal to zero disables the RSS feature.
