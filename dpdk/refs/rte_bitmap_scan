 * Bitmap scan (with automatic wrap-around)
 *
 * @param bmp
 *   Handle to bitmap instance
 * @param pos
 *   When function call returns 1, pos contains the position of the next set
 *   bit, otherwise not modified
 * @param slab
 *   When function call returns 1, slab contains the value of the entire 64-bit
 *   slab where the bit indicated by pos is located. Slabs are always 64-bit
 *   aligned, so the position of the first bit of the slab (this bit is not
 *   necessarily set) is pos / 64. Once a slab has been returned by the bitmap
 *   scan operation, the internal pointers of the bitmap are updated to point
 *   after this slab, so the same slab will not be returned again if it
 *   contains more than one bit which is set. When function call returns 0,
 *   slab is not modified.
 * @return
 *   0 if there is no bit set in the bitmap, 1 otherwise
