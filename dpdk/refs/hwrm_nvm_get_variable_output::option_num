	 * option_num is the option number for the data retrieved.  It is possible in the
	 * future that the option number returned would be different than requested.  This
	 * condition could occur if an option is deprecated and a new option id is defined
	 * with similar characteristics, but has a slightly different definition.  This
	 * also makes it convenient for the caller to identify the variable result with
	 * the option id from the response.
