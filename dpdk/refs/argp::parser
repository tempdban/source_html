     associated with the option, and ARG is any associated argument (NULL if
     none was supplied).  If KEY isn&apos;t understood, ARGP_ERR_UNKNOWN should be
     returned.  If a non-zero, non-ARGP_ERR_UNKNOWN value is returned, then
     parsing is stopped immediately, and that value is returned from
     argp_parse().  For special (non-user-supplied) values of KEY, see the
     ARGP_KEY_ definitions below.  */</doc>
