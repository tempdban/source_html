 * bman_rcr_is_empty - Determine if portal&apos;s RCR is empty
 *
 * For use in situations where a cpu-affine caller needs to determine when all
 * releases for the local portal have been processed by Bman but can&apos;t use the
 * BMAN_RELEASE_FLAG_WAIT_SYNC flag to do this from the final bman_release().
 * The function forces tracking of RCR consumption (which normally doesn&apos;t
 * happen until release processing needs to find space to put new release
 * commands), and returns zero if the ring still has unprocessed entries,
 * non-zero if it is empty.
