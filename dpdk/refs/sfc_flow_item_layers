 * At now flow API is implemented in such a manner that each
 * flow rule is converted to one or more hardware filters.
 * All elements of flow rule (attributes, pattern items, actions)
 * correspond to one or more fields in the efx_filter_spec_s structure
 * that is responsible for the hardware filter.
 * If some required field is unset in the flow rule, then a handful
 * of filter copies will be created to cover all possible values
 * of such a field.
