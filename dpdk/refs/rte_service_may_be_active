 * @warning
 * @b EXPERIMENTAL: this API may change, or be removed, without prior notice
 *
 * This function returns whether the service may be currently executing on
 * at least one lcore, or definitely is not. This function can be used to
 * determine if, after setting the service runstate to stopped, the service
 * is still executing a service lcore.
 *
 * Care must be taken if calling this function when the service runstate is
 * running, since the result of this function may be incorrect by the time the
 * function returns due to service cores running in parallel.
 *
 * @retval 1 Service may be running on one or more lcores
 * @retval 0 Service is not running on any lcore
 * @retval -EINVAL Invalid service id
