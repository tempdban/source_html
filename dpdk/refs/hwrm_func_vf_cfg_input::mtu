	 * The maximum transmission unit requested on the function.
	 * The HWRM should make sure that the mtu of
	 * the function does not exceed the mtu of the physical
	 * port that this function is associated with.
	 *
	 * In addition to requesting mtu per function, it is
	 * possible to configure mtu per transmit ring.
	 * By default, the mtu of each transmit ring associated
	 * with a function is equal to the mtu of the function.
	 * The HWRM should make sure that the mtu of each transmit
	 * ring that is assigned to a function has a valid mtu.
