<dec f='include/unistd.h' l='444' type='unsigned int sleep(unsigned int __seconds)'/>
<doc f='include/unistd.h' l='434'>/* Make the process sleep for SECONDS seconds, or until a signal arrives
   and is not ignored.  The function returns the number of seconds less
   than SECONDS which it actually slept (thus zero if it slept the full time).
   If a signal handler does a `longjmp&apos; or modifies the handling of the
   SIGALRM signal while inside `sleep&apos; call, the handling of the SIGALRM
   signal afterwards is undefined.  There is no return value to indicate
   error, but if `sleep&apos; returns SECONDS, it probably didn&apos;t work.

   This function is a cancellation point and therefore not marked with
   __THROW.  */</doc>
