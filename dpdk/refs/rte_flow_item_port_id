 * RTE_FLOW_ITEM_TYPE_PORT_ID
 *
 * Matches traffic originating from (ingress) or going to (egress) a given
 * DPDK port ID.
 *
 * Normally only supported if the port ID in question is known by the
 * underlying PMD and related to the device the flow rule is created
 * against.
 *
 * This must not be confused with @p PHY_PORT which refers to the physical
 * port of a device, whereas @p PORT_ID refers to a struct rte_eth_dev
 * object on the application side (also known as &quot;port representor&quot;
 * depending on the kind of underlying device).
