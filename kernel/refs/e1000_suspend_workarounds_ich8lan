 *  e1000_suspend_workarounds_ich8lan - workarounds needed during S0-&gt;Sx
 *  @hw: pointer to the HW structure
 *
 *  During S0 to Sx transition, it is possible the link remains at gig
 *  instead of negotiating to a lower speed.  Before going to Sx, set
 *  &apos;Gig Disable&apos; to force link speed negotiation to a lower speed based on
 *  the LPLU setting in the NVM or custom setting.  For PCH and newer parts,
 *  the OEM bits PHY register (LED, GbE disable and LPLU configurations) also
 *  needs to be written.
 *  Parts that support (and are linked to a partner which support) EEE in
 *  100Mbps should disable LPLU since 100Mbps w/ EEE requires less power
 *  than 10Mbps w/o EEE.
