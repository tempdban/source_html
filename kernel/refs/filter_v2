 * This is a strict superset of &quot;struct filter&quot; and exists only
 * because many drivers use &quot;sizeof (struct filter)&quot; in deciding TLV size.
 * This new, larger struct filter would cause any code that uses that method
 * to not work with older firmware, so we add filter_v2 to hold the
 * new filter types.  Drivers should use vnic_filter_size() to determine
 * the TLV size instead of sizeof (struct fiter_v2) to guard against future
 * growth.
