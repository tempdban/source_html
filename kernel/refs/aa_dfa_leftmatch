 * aa_dfa_leftmatch - traverse @dfa to find state @str stops at
 * @dfa: the dfa to match @str against  (NOT NULL)
 * @start: the state of the dfa to start matching in
 * @str: the null terminated string of bytes to match against the dfa (NOT NULL)
 * @count: current count of longest left.
 *
 * aa_dfa_match will match @str against the dfa and return the state it
 * finished matching in. The final state can be used to look up the accepting
 * label, or as the start state of a continuing match.
 *
 * Returns: final state reached after input is consumed
