extern int deflateInit (z_streamp strm, int level);

     Initializes the internal stream state for compression. The fields
   zalloc, zfree and opaque must be initialized before by the caller.
   If zalloc and zfree are set to NULL, deflateInit updates them to
   use default allocation functions.

     The compression level must be Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION, or between 0 and 9:
   1 gives best speed, 9 gives best compression, 0 gives no compression at
   all (the input data is simply copied a block at a time).
   Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION requests a default compromise between speed and
   compression (currently equivalent to level 6).

     deflateInit returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not
   enough memory, Z_STREAM_ERROR if level is not a valid compression level,
   Z_VERSION_ERROR if the zlib library version (zlib_version) is incompatible
   with the version assumed by the caller (ZLIB_VERSION).
   msg is set to null if there is no error message.  deflateInit does not
   perform any compression: this will be done by deflate().
