 * struct dp_stats_percpu - per-cpu packet processing statistics for a given
 * datapath.
 * @n_hit: Number of received packets for which a matching flow was found in
 * the flow table.
 * @n_miss: Number of received packets that had no matching flow in the flow
 * table.  The sum of @n_hit and @n_miss is the number of packets that have
 * been received by the datapath.
 * @n_lost: Number of received packets that had no matching flow in the flow
 * table that could not be sent to userspace (normally due to an overflow in
 * one of the datapath&apos;s queues).
 * @n_mask_hit: Number of masks looked up for flow match.
 *   @n_mask_hit / (@n_hit + @n_missed)  will be the average masks looked
 *   up per packet.
