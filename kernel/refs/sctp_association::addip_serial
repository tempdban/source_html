	 * A2) A serial number should be assigned to the Chunk. The
	 * serial number SHOULD be a monotonically increasing
	 * number. The serial number SHOULD be initialized at
	 * the start of the association to the same value as the
	 * Initial TSN and every time a new ASCONF chunk is created
	 * it is incremented by one after assigning the serial number
	 * to the newly created chunk.

	 * Serial Number : 32 bits (unsigned integer)
	 *
	 * This value represents a Serial Number for the ASCONF
	 * Chunk. The valid range of Serial Number is from 0 to
	 * 4294967295 (2^32 - 1).  Serial Numbers wrap back to 0
	 * after reaching 4294967295.
