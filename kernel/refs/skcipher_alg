 * struct skcipher_alg - symmetric key cipher definition
 * @min_keysize: Minimum key size supported by the transformation. This is the
 *		 smallest key length supported by this transformation algorithm.
 *		 This must be set to one of the pre-defined values as this is
 *		 not hardware specific. Possible values for this field can be
 *		 found via git grep &quot;_MIN_KEY_SIZE&quot; include/crypto/
 * @max_keysize: Maximum key size supported by the transformation. This is the
 *		 largest key length supported by this transformation algorithm.
 *		 This must be set to one of the pre-defined values as this is
 *		 not hardware specific. Possible values for this field can be
 *		 found via git grep &quot;_MAX_KEY_SIZE&quot; include/crypto/
 * @setkey: Set key for the transformation. This function is used to either
 *	    program a supplied key into the hardware or store the key in the
 *	    transformation context for programming it later. Note that this
 *	    function does modify the transformation context. This function can
 *	    be called multiple times during the existence of the transformation
 *	    object, so one must make sure the key is properly reprogrammed into
 *	    the hardware. This function is also responsible for checking the key
 *	    length for validity. In case a software fallback was put in place in
 *	    the @cra_init call, this function might need to use the fallback if
 *	    the algorithm doesn&apos;t support all of the key sizes.
 * @encrypt: Encrypt a scatterlist of blocks. This function is used to encrypt
 *	     the supplied scatterlist containing the blocks of data. The crypto
 *	     API consumer is responsible for aligning the entries of the
 *	     scatterlist properly and making sure the chunks are correctly
 *	     sized. In case a software fallback was put in place in the
 *	     @cra_init call, this function might need to use the fallback if
 *	     the algorithm doesn&apos;t support all of the key sizes. In case the
 *	     key was stored in transformation context, the key might need to be
 *	     re-programmed into the hardware in this function. This function
 *	     shall not modify the transformation context, as this function may
 *	     be called in parallel with the same transformation object.
 * @decrypt: Decrypt a single block. This is a reverse counterpart to @encrypt
 *	     and the conditions are exactly the same.
 * @init: Initialize the cryptographic transformation object. This function
 *	  is used to initialize the cryptographic transformation object.
 *	  This function is called only once at the instantiation time, right
 *	  after the transformation context was allocated. In case the
 *	  cryptographic hardware has some special requirements which need to
 *	  be handled by software, this function shall check for the precise
 *	  requirement of the transformation and put any software fallbacks
 *	  in place.
 * @exit: Deinitialize the cryptographic transformation object. This is a
 *	  counterpart to @init, used to remove various changes set in
 *	  @init.
 * @ivsize: IV size applicable for transformation. The consumer must provide an
 *	    IV of exactly that size to perform the encrypt or decrypt operation.
 * @chunksize: Equal to the block size except for stream ciphers such as
 *	       CTR where it is set to the underlying block size.
 * @walksize: Equal to the chunk size except in cases where the algorithm is
 * 	      considerably more efficient if it can operate on multiple chunks
 * 	      in parallel. Should be a multiple of chunksize.
 * @base: Definition of a generic crypto algorithm.
 *
 * All fields except @ivsize are mandatory and must be filled.
