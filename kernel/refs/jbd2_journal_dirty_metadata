<doc f='linux-4.18.y/fs/jbd2/transaction.c' l='1305'>/**
 * int jbd2_journal_dirty_metadata() -  mark a buffer as containing dirty metadata
 * @handle: transaction to add buffer to.
 * @bh: buffer to mark
 *
 * mark dirty metadata which needs to be journaled as part of the current
 * transaction.
 *
 * The buffer must have previously had jbd2_journal_get_write_access()
 * called so that it has a valid journal_head attached to the buffer
 * head.
 *
 * The buffer is placed on the transaction&apos;s metadata list and is marked
 * as belonging to the transaction.
 *
 * Returns error number or 0 on success.
 *
 * Special care needs to be taken if the buffer already belongs to the
 * current committing transaction (in which case we should have frozen
 * data present for that commit).  In that case, we don&apos;t relink the
 * buffer: that only gets done when the old transaction finally
 * completes its commit.
