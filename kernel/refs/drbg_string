 * Concatenation Helper and string operation helper
 *
 * SP800-90A requires the concatenation of different data. To avoid copying
 * buffers around or allocate additional memory, the following data structure
 * is used to point to the original memory with its size. In addition, it
 * is used to build a linked list. The linked list defines the concatenation
 * of individual buffers. The order of memory block referenced in that
 * linked list determines the order of concatenation.
