<doc f='linux-4.14.y/fs/ntfs/logfile.h' l='153'>/* The index of the first in-use log client
				   record in the array of log client records.
				   LOGFILE_NO_CLIENT means that there are no
				   in-use log client records in the array.  If
				   != LOGFILE_NO_CLIENT check that log_clients
				   &gt; client_in_use_list.  On Win2k and
				   presumably earlier, on a clean volume this
				   is LOGFILE_NO_CLIENT, i.e. there are no
				   client records in use and thus the logfile
				   is closed and hence clean.  A dirty volume
				   would have left the logfile open and hence
				   this would be != LOGFILE_NO_CLIENT, and it
				   should be 0, i.e. the first (and only)
				   client record is in use.  On WinXP and
				   presumably later, the logfile is always
				   open, even on clean shutdown so this should
				   always be 0. */</doc>
