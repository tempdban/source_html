 * FUNCTION:    acpi_get_object_info
 *
 * PARAMETERS:  handle              - Object Handle
 *              return_buffer       - Where the info is returned
 *
 * RETURN:      Status
 *
 * DESCRIPTION: Returns information about an object as gleaned from the
 *              namespace node and possibly by running several standard
 *              control methods (Such as in the case of a device.)
 *
 * For Device and Processor objects, run the Device _HID, _UID, _CID,
 * _CLS, _ADR, _sx_w, and _sx_d methods.
 *
 * Note: Allocates the return buffer, must be freed by the caller.
 *
 * Note: This interface is intended to be used during the initial device
 * discovery namespace traversal. Therefore, no complex methods can be
 * executed, especially those that access operation regions. Therefore, do
 * not add any additional methods that could cause problems in this area.
 * Because of this reason support for the following methods has been removed:
 * 1) _SUB method was removed (11/2015)
 * 2) _STA method was removed (02/2018)
 *
