 * firmware commands. We cannot send firmware commands while holding a
 * spinlock, since it might sleep. To avoid this, we wrap the added filters in
 * a separate structure, which will track the state change and update the real
 * filter while under lock. We can&apos;t simply hold the filters in a separate
 * list, as this opens a window for a race condition when adding new MAC
 * addresses to all VLANs, or when adding new VLANs to all MAC addresses.
