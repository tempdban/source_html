 * async_tx_flags - modifiers for the async_* calls

 * array.
 * @ASYNC_TX_ACK: immediately ack the descriptor, precludes setting up a
 * dependency chain
 * @ASYNC_TX_FENCE: specify that the next operation in the dependency
 * chain uses this operation&apos;s result as an input
 * @ASYNC_TX_PQ_XOR_DST: do not overwrite the syndrome but XOR it with the
 * input data. Required for rmw case.
