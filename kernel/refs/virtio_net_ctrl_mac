 * Control the MAC

 * non-perfect, ie. based on hypervisor resources, the guest may
 * received packets from sources not specified in the filter list.
 *
 * In addition to the class/cmd header, the TABLE_SET command requires
 * two out scatterlists.  Each contains a 4 byte count of entries followed
 * by a concatenated byte stream of the ETH_ALEN MAC addresses.  The
 * first sg list contains unicast addresses, the second is for multicast.
 * This functionality is present if the VIRTIO_NET_F_CTRL_RX feature
 * is available.
 *
 * The ADDR_SET command requests one out scatterlist, it contains a
 * 6 bytes MAC address. This functionality is present if the
 * VIRTIO_NET_F_CTRL_MAC_ADDR feature is available.
