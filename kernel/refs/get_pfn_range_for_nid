 * get_pfn_range_for_nid - Return the start and end page frames for a node
 * @nid: The nid to return the range for. If MAX_NUMNODES, the min and max PFN are returned.
 * @start_pfn: Passed by reference. On return, it will have the node start_pfn.
 * @end_pfn: Passed by reference. On return, it will have the node end_pfn.
 *
 * It returns the start and end page frame of a node based on information
 * provided by memblock_set_node(). If called for a node
 * with no available memory, a warning is printed and the start and end
 * PFNs will be 0.
