 * LZ4_compress_fast() - As LZ4_compress_default providing an acceleration param
 * @source: source address of the original data
 * @dest: output buffer address of the compressed data
 * @inputSize: size of the input data. Max supported value is LZ4_MAX_INPUT_SIZE
 * @maxOutputSize: full or partial size of buffer &apos;dest&apos;
 *	which must be already allocated
 * @acceleration: acceleration factor
 * @wrkmem: address of the working memory.
 *	This requires &apos;workmem&apos; of LZ4_MEM_COMPRESS.
 *
 * Same as LZ4_compress_default(), but allows to select an &quot;acceleration&quot;
 * factor. The larger the acceleration value, the faster the algorithm,
 * but also the lesser the compression. It&apos;s a trade-off. It can be fine tuned,
 * with each successive value providing roughly +~3% to speed.
 * An acceleration value of &quot;1&quot; is the same as regular LZ4_compress_default()
 * Values &lt;= 0 will be replaced by LZ4_ACCELERATION_DEFAULT, which is 1.
 *
 * Return: Number of bytes written into buffer &apos;dest&apos;
 *	(necessarily &lt;= maxOutputSize) or 0 if compression fails
