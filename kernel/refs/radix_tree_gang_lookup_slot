 *	radix_tree_gang_lookup_slot - perform multiple slot lookup on radix tree
 *	@root:		radix tree root
 *	@results:	where the results of the lookup are placed
 *	@indices:	where their indices should be placed (but usually NULL)
 *	@first_index:	start the lookup from this key
 *	@max_items:	place up to this many items at *results
 *
 *	Performs an index-ascending scan of the tree for present items.  Places
 *	their slots at *@results and returns the number of items which were
 *	placed at *@results.
 *
 *	The implementation is naive.
 *
 *	Like radix_tree_gang_lookup as far as RCU and locking goes. Slots must
 *	be dereferenced with radix_tree_deref_slot, and if using only RCU
 *	protection, radix_tree_deref_slot may fail requiring a retry.
