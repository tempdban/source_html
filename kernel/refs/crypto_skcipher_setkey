 * crypto_skcipher_setkey() - set key for cipher
 * @tfm: cipher handle
 * @key: buffer holding the key
 * @keylen: length of the key in bytes
 *
 * The caller provided key is set for the skcipher referenced by the cipher
 * handle.
 *
 * Note, the key length determines the cipher type. Many block ciphers implement
 * different cipher modes depending on the key size, such as AES-128 vs AES-192
 * vs. AES-256. When providing a 16 byte key for an AES cipher handle, AES-128
 * is performed.
 *
 * Return: 0 if the setting of the key was successful; &lt; 0 if an error occurred
