 * Get filesystem&apos;s extents as described in head, and format for
 * output.  Calls formatter to fill the user&apos;s buffer until all
 * extents are mapped, until the passed-in head-&gt;fmh_count slots have
 * been filled, or until the formatter short-circuits the loop, if it
 * is tracking filled-in extents on its own.
 *
 * Key to Confusion
 * ----------------
 * There are multiple levels of keys and counters at work here:
 * _fsmap_head.fmh_keys		-- low and high fsmap keys passed in;
 * 				   these reflect fs-wide block addrs.
 * dkeys			-- fmh_keys used to query each device;
 * 				   these are fmh_keys but w/ the low key
 * 				   bumped up by fmr_length.
 * _getfsmap_info.gfi_next_fsblk-- next fs block we expect to see; this
 *				   is how we detect gaps in the fsmap
 *				   records and report them.
 * _getfsmap_info.gfi_low/high	-- per-bg low/high keys computed from
 * 				   dkeys; used to query the free space.
