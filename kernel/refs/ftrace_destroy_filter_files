 * in the future, it may actualy delete the files, but this is
 * really intended to make sure the ops passed in are disabled
 * and that when this function returns, the caller is free to
 * free the ops.
 *
 * The &quot;destroy&quot; name is only to match the &quot;create&quot; name that this
 * should be paired with.
