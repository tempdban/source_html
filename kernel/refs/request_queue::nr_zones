	 * Zoned block device information for request dispatch control.
	 * nr_zones is the total number of zones of the device. This is always
	 * 0 for regular block devices. seq_zones_bitmap is a bitmap of nr_zones
	 * bits which indicates if a zone is conventional (bit clear) or
	 * sequential (bit set). seq_zones_wlock is a bitmap of nr_zones
	 * bits which indicates if a zone is write locked, that is, if a write
	 * request targeting the zone was dispatched. All three fields are
	 * initialized by the low level device driver (e.g. scsi/sd.c).
	 * Stacking drivers (device mappers) may or may not initialize
	 * these fields.
	 *
	 * Reads of this information must be protected with blk_queue_enter() /
	 * blk_queue_exit(). Modifying this information is only allowed while
	 * no requests are being processed. See also blk_mq_freeze_queue() and
	 * blk_mq_unfreeze_queue().
