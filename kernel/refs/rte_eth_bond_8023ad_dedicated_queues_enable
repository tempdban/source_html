 * Enable dedicated hw queues for 802.3ad control plane traffic on on slaves
 *
 * This function creates an additional tx and rx queue on each slave for
 * dedicated 802.3ad control plane traffic . A flow filtering rule is
 * programmed on each slave to redirect all LACP slow packets to that rx queue
 * for processing in the LACP state machine, this removes the need to filter
 * these packets in the bonded devices data path. The additional tx queue is
 * used to enable the LACP state machine to enqueue LACP packets directly to
 * slave hw independently of the bonded devices data path.
 *
 * To use this feature all slaves must support the programming of the flow
 * filter rule required for rx and have enough queues that one rx and tx queue
 * can be reserved for the LACP state machines control packets.
 *
 * Bonding port must be stopped to change this configuration.
 *
 * @param port_id      Bonding device id
 *
 * @return
 *   0 on success, negative value otherwise.
