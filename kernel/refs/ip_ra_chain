   They are selected only by protocol field, and then processed likely
   local ones; but only if someone wants them! Otherwise, router
   not running rsvpd will kill RSVP.

   It is user level problem, what it will make with them.
   I have no idea, how it will masquearde or NAT them (it is joke, joke :-)),
   but receiver should be enough clever f.e. to forward mtrace requests,
   sent to multicast group to reach destination designated router.
