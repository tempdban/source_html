 * enum svga3d_block_desc describes the active data channels in a block.
 *
 * There can be at-most four active channels in a block:
 *    1. Red, bump W, luminance and depth are stored in the first channel.
 *    2. Green, bump V and stencil are stored in the second channel.
 *    3. Blue and bump U are stored in the third channel.
 *    4. Alpha and bump Q are stored in the fourth channel.
 *
 * Block channels can be used to store compressed and buffer data:
 *    1. For compressed formats, only the data channel is used and its size
 *       is equal to that of a singular block in the compression scheme.
 *    2. For buffer formats, only the data channel is used and its size is
 *       exactly one byte in length.
 *    3. In each case the bit depth represent the size of a singular block.
 *
 * Note: Compressed and IEEE formats do not use the bitMask structure.
