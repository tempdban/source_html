 * struct drm_info_node - Per-minor debugfs node structure
 *
 * This structure represents a debugfs file, as an instantiation of a &amp;struct
 * drm_info_list on a &amp;struct drm_minor.
 *
 * FIXME:
 *
 * No it doesn&apos;t make a hole lot of sense that we duplicate debugfs entries for
 * both the render and the primary nodes, but that&apos;s how this has organically
 * grown. It should probably be fixed, with a compatibility link, if needed.
