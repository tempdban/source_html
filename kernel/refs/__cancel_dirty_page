 * This cancels just the dirty bit on the kernel page itself, it does NOT
 * actually remove dirty bits on any mmap&apos;s that may be around. It also
 * leaves the page tagged dirty, so any sync activity will still find it on
 * the dirty lists, and in particular, clear_page_dirty_for_io() will still
 * look at the dirty bits in the VM.
 *
 * Doing this should *normally* only ever be done when a page is truncated,
 * and is not actually mapped anywhere at all. However, fs/buffer.c does
 * this when it notices that somebody has cleaned out all the buffers on a
 * page without actually doing it through the VM. Can you say &quot;ext3 is
 * horribly ugly&quot;? Thought you could.
