 * USB-2.0 Specification Sections 11.14 and 11.18
 * Scheduling and budgeting split transactions using TTs
 *
 * A hub can have a single TT for all its ports, or multiple TTs (one for each
 * port).  The bandwidth and budgeting information for the full/low-speed bus
 * below each TT is self-contained and independent of the other TTs or the
 * high-speed bus.
 *
 * &quot;Bandwidth&quot; refers to the number of microseconds on the FS/LS bus allocated
 * to an interrupt or isochronous endpoint for each frame.  &quot;Budget&quot; refers to
 * the best-case estimate of the number of full-speed bytes allocated to an
 * endpoint for each microframe within an allocated frame.
 *
 * Removal of an endpoint invalidates a TT&apos;s budget.  Instead of trying to
 * keep an up-to-date record, we recompute the budget when it is needed.
