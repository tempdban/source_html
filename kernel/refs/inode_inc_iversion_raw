 * @inode: inode that needs to be updated
 *
 * Forcbily increment the raw i_version field. This always results in a change
 * to the raw value.
 *
 * NFS will use the i_version field to store the value from the server. It
 * mostly treats it as opaque, but in the case where it holds a write
 * delegation, it must increment the value itself. This function does that.
