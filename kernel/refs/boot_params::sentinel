	 * The sentinel is set to a nonzero value (0xff) in header.S.
	 *
	 * A bootloader is supposed to only take setup_header and put
	 * it into a clean boot_params buffer. If it turns out that
	 * it is clumsy or too generous with the buffer, it most
	 * probably will pick up the sentinel variable too. The fact
	 * that this variable then is still 0xff will let kernel
	 * know that some variables in boot_params are invalid and
	 * kernel should zero out certain portions of boot_params.
