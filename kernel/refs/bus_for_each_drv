 * bus_for_each_drv - driver iterator
 * @bus: bus we&apos;re dealing with.
 * @start: driver to start iterating on.
 * @data: data to pass to the callback.
 * @fn: function to call for each driver.
 *
 * This is nearly identical to the device iterator above.
 * We iterate over each driver that belongs to @bus, and call
 * @fn for each. If @fn returns anything but 0, we break out

 *
 * NOTE: we don&apos;t return the driver that returns a non-zero
 * value, nor do we leave the reference count incremented for that
 * driver. If the caller needs to know that info, it must set it
 * in the callback. It must also be sure to increment the refcount
 * so it doesn&apos;t disappear before returning to the caller.
