 * A blkcg_gq (blkg) is association between a block cgroup (blkcg) and a
 * request_queue (q).  This is used by blkcg policies which need to track
 * information per blkcg - q pair.
 *
 * There can be multiple active blkcg policies and each blkg:policy pair is
 * represented by a blkg_policy_data which is allocated and freed by each
 * policy&apos;s pd_alloc/free_fn() methods.  A policy can allocate private data
 * area by allocating larger data structure which embeds blkg_policy_data
 * at the beginning.
