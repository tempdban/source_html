 * node_map_pfn_alignment - determine the maximum internode alignment
 *
 * This function should be called after node map is populated and sorted.
 * It calculates the maximum power of two alignment which can distinguish
 * all the nodes.
 *
 * For example, if all nodes are 1GiB and aligned to 1GiB, the return value
 * would indicate 1GiB alignment with (1 &lt;&lt; (30 - PAGE_SHIFT)).  If the
 * nodes are shifted by 256MiB, 256MiB.  Note that if only the last node is
 * shifted, 1GiB is enough and this function will indicate so.
 *
 * This is used to test whether pfn -&gt; nid mapping of the chosen memory
 * model has fine enough granularity to avoid incorrect mapping for the
 * populated node map.
 *
 * Returns the determined alignment in pfn&apos;s.  0 if there is no alignment
 * requirement (single node).
