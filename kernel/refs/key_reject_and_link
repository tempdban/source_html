 * key_reject_and_link - Negatively instantiate a key and link it into the keyring.
 * @key: The key to instantiate.
 * @timeout: The timeout on the negative key.
 * @error: The error to return when the key is hit.
 * @keyring: Keyring to create a link in on success (or NULL).
 * @authkey: The authorisation token permitting instantiation.
 *
 * Negatively instantiate a key that&apos;s in the uninstantiated state and, if
 * successful, set its timeout and stored error and link it in to the
 * destination keyring if one is supplied.  The key and any links to the key
 * will be automatically garbage collected after the timeout expires.
 *
 * Negative keys are used to rate limit repeated request_key() calls by causing
 * them to return the stored error code (typically ENOKEY) until the negative
 * key expires.
 *
 * If successful, 0 is returned, the authorisation token is revoked and anyone
 * waiting for the key is woken up.  If the key was already instantiated,
 * -EBUSY will be returned.
