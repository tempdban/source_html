<doc f='linux-4.14.y/include/rdma/ib_verbs.h' l='2594'>/**
 * rdma_cap_ib_smi - Check if the port of a device provides an Infiniband
 * Subnet Management Agent (SMA) on the Subnet Management Interface (SMI).
 * @device: Device to check
 * @port_num: Port number to check
 *
 * Each InfiniBand node is required to provide a Subnet Management Agent
 * that the subnet manager can access.  Prior to the fabric being fully
 * configured by the subnet manager, the SMA is accessed via a well known
 * interface called the Subnet Management Interface (SMI).  This interface
 * uses directed route packets to communicate with the SM to get around the
 * chicken and egg problem of the SM needing to know what&apos;s on the fabric
 * in order to configure the fabric, and needing to configure the fabric in
 * order to send packets to the devices on the fabric.  These directed
 * route packets do not need the fabric fully configured in order to reach
 * their destination.  The SMI is the only method allowed to send
 * directed route packets on an InfiniBand fabric.
 *
 * Return: true if the port provides an SMI.
