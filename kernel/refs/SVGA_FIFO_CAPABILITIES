    * Block 2 (extended registers): Mandatory registers for the extended
    * FIFO.  These exist if the SVGA caps register includes
    * SVGA_CAP_EXTENDED_FIFO; some of them are valid only if their
    * associated capability bit is enabled.
    *
    * Note that when originally defined, SVGA_CAP_EXTENDED_FIFO implied
    * support only for (FIFO registers) CAPABILITIES, FLAGS, and FENCE.
    * This means that the guest has to test individually (in most cases
    * using FIFO caps) for the presence of registers after this; the VMX
    * can define &quot;extended FIFO&quot; to mean whatever it wants, and currently
    * won&apos;t enable it unless there&apos;s room for that set and much more.
