 * crypto_blkcipher_encrypt() - encrypt plaintext
 * @desc: reference to the block cipher handle with meta data
 * @dst: scatter/gather list that is filled by the cipher operation with the
 *	ciphertext
 * @src: scatter/gather list that holds the plaintext
 * @nbytes: number of bytes of the plaintext to encrypt.
 *
 * Encrypt plaintext data using the IV set by the caller with a preceding
 * call of crypto_blkcipher_set_iv.
 *
 * The blkcipher_desc data structure must be filled by the caller and can
 * reside on the stack. The caller must fill desc as follows: desc.tfm is filled
 * with the block cipher handle; desc.flags is filled with either
 * CRYPTO_TFM_REQ_MAY_SLEEP or 0.
 *
 * Return: 0 if the cipher operation was successful; &lt; 0 if an error occurred
