	 * Restartable sequences rseq_cs field.
	 *
	 * Contains NULL when no critical section is active for the current
	 * thread, or holds a pointer to the currently active struct rseq_cs.
	 *
	 * Updated by user-space, which sets the address of the currently
	 * active rseq_cs at the beginning of assembly instruction sequence
	 * block, and set to NULL by the kernel when it restarts an assembly
	 * instruction sequence block, as well as when the kernel detects that
	 * it is preempting or delivering a signal outside of the range
	 * targeted by the rseq_cs. Also needs to be set to NULL by user-space
	 * before reclaiming memory that contains the targeted struct rseq_cs.
	 *
	 * Read and set by the kernel. Set by user-space with single-copy
	 * atomicity semantics. This field should only be updated by the
	 * thread which registered this data structure. Aligned on 64-bit.
