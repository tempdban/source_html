 * enum ovs_packet_attr - attributes for %OVS_PACKET_* commands.
 * @OVS_PACKET_ATTR_PACKET: Present for all notifications.  Contains the entire
 * packet as received, from the start of the Ethernet header onward.  For
 * %OVS_PACKET_CMD_ACTION, %OVS_PACKET_ATTR_PACKET reflects changes made by
 * actions preceding %OVS_ACTION_ATTR_USERSPACE, but %OVS_PACKET_ATTR_KEY is
 * the flow key extracted from the packet as originally received.
 * @OVS_PACKET_ATTR_KEY: Present for all notifications.  Contains the flow key
 * extracted from the packet as nested %OVS_KEY_ATTR_* attributes.  This allows
 * userspace to adapt its flow setup strategy by comparing its notion of the
 * flow key against the kernel&apos;s.
 * @OVS_PACKET_ATTR_ACTIONS: Contains actions for the packet.  Used
 * for %OVS_PACKET_CMD_EXECUTE.  It has nested %OVS_ACTION_ATTR_* attributes.
 * Also used in upcall when %OVS_ACTION_ATTR_USERSPACE has optional
 * %OVS_USERSPACE_ATTR_ACTIONS attribute.
 * @OVS_PACKET_ATTR_USERDATA: Present for an %OVS_PACKET_CMD_ACTION
 * notification if the %OVS_ACTION_ATTR_USERSPACE action specified an
 * %OVS_USERSPACE_ATTR_USERDATA attribute, with the same length and content
 * specified there.
 * @OVS_PACKET_ATTR_EGRESS_TUN_KEY: Present for an %OVS_PACKET_CMD_ACTION
 * notification if the %OVS_ACTION_ATTR_USERSPACE action specified an
 * %OVS_USERSPACE_ATTR_EGRESS_TUN_PORT attribute, which is sent only if the
 * output port is actually a tunnel port. Contains the output tunnel key
 * extracted from the packet as nested %OVS_TUNNEL_KEY_ATTR_* attributes.
 * @OVS_PACKET_ATTR_MRU: Present for an %OVS_PACKET_CMD_ACTION and
 * @OVS_PACKET_ATTR_LEN: Packet size before truncation.
 * %OVS_PACKET_ATTR_USERSPACE action specify the Maximum received fragment
 * size.
 *
 * These attributes follow the &amp;struct ovs_header within the Generic Netlink
 * payload for %OVS_PACKET_* commands.
