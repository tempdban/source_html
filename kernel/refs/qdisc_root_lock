 * of a qdisc tree can be locked from any qdisc node in the
 * forest.  This allows changing the configuration of some
 * aspect of the qdisc tree while blocking out asynchronous
 * qdisc access in the packet processing paths.
 *
 * It is only legal to do this when the root will not change
 * on us.  Otherwise we&apos;ll potentially lock the wrong qdisc
 * root.  This is enforced by holding the RTNL semaphore, which
 * all users of this lock accessor must do.
