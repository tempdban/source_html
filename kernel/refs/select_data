 * Search the dentry child list of the specified parent,
 * and move any unused dentries to the end of the unused
 * list for prune_dcache(). We descend to the next level
 * whenever the d_subdirs list is non-empty and continue
 * searching.
 *
 * It returns zero iff there are no unused children,
 * otherwise  it returns the number of children moved to
 * the end of the unused list. This may not be the total
 * number of unused children, because select_parent can
 * drop the lock and return early due to latency
 * constraints.
