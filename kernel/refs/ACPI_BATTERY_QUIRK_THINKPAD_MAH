<doc f='linux-4.18.y/drivers/acpi/battery.c' l='104'>/* On Lenovo Thinkpad models from 2010 and 2011, the power unit
	   switches between mWh and mAh depending on whether the system
	   is running on battery or not.  When mAh is the unit, most
	   reported values are incorrect and need to be adjusted by
	   10000/design_voltage.  Verified on x201, t410, t410s, and x220.
	   Pre-2010 and 2012 models appear to always report in mWh and
	   are thus unaffected (tested with t42, t61, t500, x200, x300,
	   and x230).  Also, in mid-2012 Lenovo issued a BIOS update for
	   the 2011 models that fixes the issue (tested on x220 with a
	   post-1.29 BIOS), but as of Nov. 2012, no such update is
	   available for the 2010 models.  */</doc>
