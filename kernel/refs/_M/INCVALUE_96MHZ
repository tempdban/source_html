<doc f='linux-4.18.y/drivers/net/ethernet/intel/e1000e/e1000.h' l='349'>/* The system time is maintained by a 64-bit counter comprised of the 32-bit
 * SYSTIMH and SYSTIML registers.  How the counter increments (and therefore
 * its resolution) is based on the contents of the TIMINCA register - it
 * increments every incperiod (bits 31:24) clock ticks by incvalue (bits 23:0).
 * For the best accuracy, the incperiod should be as small as possible.  The
 * incvalue is scaled by a factor as large as possible (while still fitting
 * in bits 23:0) so that relatively small clock corrections can be made.
 *
 * As a result, a shift of INCVALUE_SHIFT_n is used to fit a value of
 * INCVALUE_n into the TIMINCA register allowing 32+8+(24-INCVALUE_SHIFT_n)
 * bits to count nanoseconds leaving the rest for fractional nonseconds.
