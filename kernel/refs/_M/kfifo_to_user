 * kfifo_to_user - copies data from the fifo into user space
 * @fifo: address of the fifo to be used
 * @to: where the data must be copied
 * @len: the size of the destination buffer
 * @copied: pointer to output variable to store the number of copied bytes
 *
 * This macro copies at most @len bytes from the fifo into the
 * @to buffer and returns -EFAULT/0.
 *
 * Note that with only one concurrent reader and one concurrent
 * writer, you don&apos;t need extra locking to use these macro.
