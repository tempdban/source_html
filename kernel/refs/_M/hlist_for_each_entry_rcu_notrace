 * hlist_for_each_entry_rcu_notrace - iterate over rcu list of given type (for tracing)
 * @pos:	the type * to use as a loop cursor.
 * @head:	the head for your list.
 * @member:	the name of the hlist_node within the struct.
 *
 * This list-traversal primitive may safely run concurrently with
 * the _rcu list-mutation primitives such as hlist_add_head_rcu()
 * as long as the traversal is guarded by rcu_read_lock().
 *
 * This is the same as hlist_for_each_entry_rcu() except that it does
 * not do any RCU debugging or tracing.
