 * This is a lookup table for speeding up access to the .orc_unwind table.
 * Given an input address offset, the corresponding lookup table entry
 * specifies a subset of the .orc_unwind table to search.
 *
 * Each block represents the end of the previous range and the start of the
 * next range.  An extra block is added to give the last range an end.
 *
 * The block size should be a power of 2 to avoid a costly &apos;div&apos; instruction.
 *
 * A block size of 256 was chosen because it roughly doubles unwinder
 * performance while only adding ~5% to the ORC data footprint.
