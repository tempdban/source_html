<doc f='linux-4.18.y/drivers/net/sfc/base/efx_regs_mcdi.h' l='12281'>/* Hash control flags. If all _MODE bits are zero (which will always be true
 * for older firmware which does not report the ADDITIONAL_RSS_MODES
 * capability), the _EN bits report the state. If any _MODE bits are non-zero
 * (which will only be true when the firmware reports ADDITIONAL_RSS_MODES)
 * then the _EN bits should be disregarded, although the _MODE flags are
 * guaranteed to be consistent with the _EN flags for a freshly-allocated RSS
 * context and in the case where the _EN flags were used in the SET. This
 * provides backward compatibility: old drivers will not be attempting to
 * derive any meaning from the _MODE bits (and can never set them to any value
 * not representable by the _EN bits); new drivers can always determine the
 * mode by looking only at the _MODE bits; the value returned by a GET can
 * always be used for a SET regardless of old/new driver vs. old/new firmware.
