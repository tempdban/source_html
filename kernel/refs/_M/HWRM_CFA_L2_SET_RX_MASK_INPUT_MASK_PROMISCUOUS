	 * When this bit is &apos;1&apos;, the function is requested to be
	 * put in the promiscuous mode.
	 *
	 * The HWRM should accept any function to set up
	 * promiscuous mode.
	 *
	 * The HWRM shall follow the semantics below for the
	 * promiscuous mode support.
	 * # When partitioning is not enabled on a port
	 * (i.e. single PF on the port), then the PF shall
	 * be allowed to be in the promiscuous mode. When the
	 * PF is in the promiscuous mode, then it shall
	 * receive all host bound traffic on that port.
	 * # When partitioning is enabled on a port
	 * (i.e. multiple PFs per port) and a PF on that
	 * port is in the promiscuous mode, then the PF
	 * receives all traffic within that partition as
	 * identified by a unique identifier for the
	 * PF (e.g. S-Tag). If a unique outer VLAN
	 * for the PF is specified, then the setting of
	 * promiscuous mode on that PF shall result in the
	 * PF receiving all host bound traffic with matching
	 * outer VLAN.
	 * # A VF shall can be set in the promiscuous mode.
	 * In the promiscuous mode, the VF does not receive any
	 * traffic unless a unique outer VLAN for the
	 * VF is specified. If a unique outer VLAN
	 * for the VF is specified, then the setting of
	 * promiscuous mode on that VF shall result in the
	 * VF receiving all host bound traffic with the
	 * matching outer VLAN.
	 * # The HWRM shall allow the setting of promiscuous
	 * mode on a function independently from the
	 * promiscuous mode settings on other functions.
