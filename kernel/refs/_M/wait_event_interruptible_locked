 * wait_event_interruptible_locked - sleep until a condition gets true
 * @wq: the waitqueue to wait on
 * @condition: a C expression for the event to wait for
 *
 * The process is put to sleep (TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE) until the
 * @condition evaluates to true or a signal is received.
 * The @condition is checked each time the waitqueue @wq is woken up.
 *
 * It must be called with wq.lock being held.  This spinlock is
 * unlocked while sleeping but @condition testing is done while lock
 * is held and when this macro exits the lock is held.
 *
 * The lock is locked/unlocked using spin_lock()/spin_unlock()
 * functions which must match the way they are locked/unlocked outside
 * of this macro.
 *
 * wake_up_locked() has to be called after changing any variable that could
 * change the result of the wait condition.
 *
 * The function will return -ERESTARTSYS if it was interrupted by a
 * signal and 0 if @condition evaluated to true.
