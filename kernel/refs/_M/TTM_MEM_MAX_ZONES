 * At this point we use only a single-threaded workqueue.
 * @work: The workqueue callback for the shrink queue.
 * @lock: Lock to protect the @shrink - and the memory accounting members,
 * that is, essentially the whole structure with some exceptions.
 * @zones: Array of pointers to accounting zones.
 * @num_zones: Number of populated entries in the @zones array.
 * @zone_kernel: Pointer to the kernel zone.
 * @zone_highmem: Pointer to the highmem zone if there is one.
 * @zone_dma32: Pointer to the dma32 zone if there is one.
 *
 * Note that this structure is not per device. It should be global for all
