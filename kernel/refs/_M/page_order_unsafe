 * Like page_order(), but for callers who cannot afford to hold the zone lock.
 * PageBuddy() should be checked first by the caller to minimize race window,
 * and invalid values must be handled gracefully.
 *
 * READ_ONCE is used so that if the caller assigns the result into a local
 * variable and e.g. tests it for valid range before using, the compiler cannot
 * decide to remove the variable and inline the page_private(page) multiple
 * times, potentially observing different values in the tests and the actual
 * use of the result.
