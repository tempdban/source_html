 * The overlap flag marks event constraints with overlapping counter
 * masks. This is the case if the counter mask of such an event is not
 * a subset of any other counter mask of a constraint with an equal or
 * higher weight, e.g.:
 *
 *  c_overlaps = EVENT_CONSTRAINT_OVERLAP(0, 0x09, 0);
 *  c_another1 = EVENT_CONSTRAINT(0, 0x07, 0);
 *  c_another2 = EVENT_CONSTRAINT(0, 0x38, 0);
 *
 * The event scheduler may not select the correct counter in the first
 * cycle because it needs to know which subsequent events will be
 * scheduled. It may fail to schedule the events then. So we set the
 * overlap flag for such constraints to give the scheduler a hint which
 * events to select for counter rescheduling.
 *
 * Care must be taken as the rescheduling algorithm is O(n!) which
 * will increase scheduling cycles for an over-committed system
 * dramatically.  The number of such EVENT_CONSTRAINT_OVERLAP() macros
 * and its counter masks must be kept at a minimum.
