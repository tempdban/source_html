<doc f='linux-4.18.y/include/linux/fb.h' l='435'>/* A driver may set this flag to indicate that it does want a set_par to be
 * called every time when fbcon_switch is executed. The advantage is that with
 * this flag set you can really be sure that set_par is always called before
 * any of the functions dependent on the correct hardware state or altering
 * that state, even if you are using some broken X releases. The disadvantage
 * is that it introduces unwanted delays to every console switch if set_par
 * is slow. It is a good idea to try this flag in the drivers initialization
 * code whenever there is a bug report related to switching between X and the
 * framebuffer console.
