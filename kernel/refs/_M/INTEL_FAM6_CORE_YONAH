 * &quot;Big Core&quot; Processors (Branded as Core, Xeon, etc...)
 *
 * The &quot;_X&quot; parts are generally the EP and EX Xeons, or the
 * &quot;Extreme&quot; ones, like Broadwell-E.
 *
 * Things ending in &quot;2&quot; are usually because we have no better
 * name for them.  There&apos;s no processor called &quot;SILVERMONT2&quot;.
 *
 * While adding a new CPUID for a new microarchitecture, add a new
 * group to keep logically sorted out in chronological order. Within
 * that group keep the CPUID for the variants sorted by model number.
