 * MSGMNI, MSGMAX and MSGMNB are default values which can be
 * modified by sysctl.
 *
 * MSGMNI is the upper limit for the number of messages queues per
 * namespace.
 * It has been chosen to be as large possible without facilitating
 * scenarios where userspace causes overflows when adjusting the limits via
 * operations of the form retrieve current limit; add X; update limit&quot;.
 *
 * MSGMNB is the default size of a new message queue. Non-root tasks can
 * decrease the size with msgctl(IPC_SET), root tasks
 * (actually: CAP_SYS_RESOURCE) can both increase and decrease the queue
 * size. The optimal value is application dependent.
 * 16384 is used because it was always used (since 0.99.10)
 *
 * MAXMAX is the maximum size of an individual message, it&apos;s a global
 * (per-namespace) limit that applies for all message queues.
 * It&apos;s set to 1/2 of MSGMNB, to ensure that at least two messages fit into
 * the queue. This is also an arbitrary choice (since 2.6.0).
