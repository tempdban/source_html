 * We put the hardirq and softirq counter into the preemption
 * counter. The bitmask has the following meaning:
 *
 * - bits 0-7 are the preemption count (max preemption depth: 256)
 * - bits 8-15 are the softirq count (max # of softirqs: 256)
 *
 * The hardirq count could in theory be the same as the number of
 * interrupts in the system, but we run all interrupt handlers with
 * interrupts disabled, so we cannot have nesting interrupts. Though
 * there are a few palaeontologic drivers which reenable interrupts in
 * the handler, so we need more than one bit here.
 *
 *         PREEMPT_MASK:	0x000000ff
 *         SOFTIRQ_MASK:	0x0000ff00
 *         HARDIRQ_MASK:	0x000f0000
 *             NMI_MASK:	0x00100000
 * PREEMPT_NEED_RESCHED:	0x80000000
