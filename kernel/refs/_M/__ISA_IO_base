 * ISA space is &apos;always mapped&apos; on a typical x86 system, no need to
 * explicitly ioremap() it. The fact that the ISA IO space is mapped
 * to PAGE_OFFSET is pure coincidence - it does not mean ISA values
 * are physical addresses. The following constant pointer can be
 * used as the IO-area pointer (it can be iounmapped as well, so the
 * analogy with PCI is quite large):
