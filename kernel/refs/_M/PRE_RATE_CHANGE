 * DOC: clk notifier callback types

 * PRE_RATE_CHANGE - called immediately before the clk rate is changed,
 *     to indicate that the rate change will proceed.  Drivers must
 *     immediately terminate any operations that will be affected by the
 *     rate change.  Callbacks may either return NOTIFY_DONE, NOTIFY_OK,
 *     NOTIFY_STOP or NOTIFY_BAD.
 *
 * ABORT_RATE_CHANGE: called if the rate change failed for some reason
 *     after PRE_RATE_CHANGE.  In this case, all registered notifiers on
 *     the clk will be called with ABORT_RATE_CHANGE. Callbacks must
 *     always return NOTIFY_DONE or NOTIFY_OK.
 *
 * POST_RATE_CHANGE - called after the clk rate change has successfully
 *     completed.  Callbacks must always return NOTIFY_DONE or NOTIFY_OK.
