 * A U1 timeout of 0x0 means the parent hub will reject any transitions to U1.
 * 0xff means the parent hub will accept transitions to U1, but will not
 * initiate a transition.
 *
 * A U1 timeout of 0x1 to 0x7F also causes the hub to initiate a transition to
 * U1 after that many microseconds.  Timeouts of 0x80 to 0xFE are reserved
 * values.
 *
 * A U2 timeout of 0x0 means the parent hub will reject any transitions to U2.
 * 0xff means the parent hub will accept transitions to U2, but will not
 * initiate a transition.
 *
 * A U2 timeout of 0x1 to 0xFE also causes the hub to initiate a transition to
 * U2 after N*256 microseconds.  Therefore a U2 timeout value of 0x1 means a U2
 * idle timer of 256 microseconds, 0x2 means 512 microseconds, 0xFE means
 * 65.024ms.
