 * Make sure the alignment of the structure in the __tracepoints section will
 * not add unwanted padding between the beginning of the section and the
 * structure. Force alignment to the same alignment as the section start.
 *
 * When lockdep is enabled, we make sure to always do the RCU portions of
 * the tracepoint code, regardless of whether tracing is on. However,
 * don&apos;t check if the condition is false, due to interaction with idle
 * instrumentation. This lets us find RCU issues triggered with tracepoints
 * even when this tracepoint is off. This code has no purpose other than
 * poking RCU a bit.
