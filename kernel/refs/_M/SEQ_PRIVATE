 *	SEQ_FULLSIZE events are used for loading patches/samples to the
 *	synthesizer devices. These events are passed directly to the driver
 *	of the associated synthesizer device. There is no limit to the size
 *	of the extended events. These events are not queued but executed
 *	immediately when the write() is called (execution can take several
 *	seconds of time). 
 *
 *	When a SEQ_FULLSIZE message is written to the device, it must
 *	be written using exactly one write() call. Other events cannot
 *	be mixed to the same write.
 *	
 *	For FM synths (YM3812/OPL3) use struct sbi_instrument and write it to the 
 *	/dev/sequencer. Don&apos;t write other data together with the instrument structure
 *	Set the key field of the structure to FM_PATCH. The device field is used to
 *	route the patch to the corresponding device.
 *
 *	For wave table use struct patch_info. Initialize the key field
 *      to WAVE_PATCH.
