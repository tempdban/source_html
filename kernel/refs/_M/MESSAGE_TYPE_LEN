 * message, and is used to protect against chosen message attacks in signed
 * messages, regardless their origin. The message type also defines the
 * signature cryptographic algorithm, encoding, and message fields included in
 * the signature. The values are used in different commands but must be unique
 * across all commands, e.g. MC_CMD_TSA_BIND_IN_SECURE_UNBIND uses different
 * message type than MC_CMD_SECURE_NIC_INFO_IN_STATUS.
