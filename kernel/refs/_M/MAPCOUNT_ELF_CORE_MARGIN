 * Default maximum number of active map areas, this limits the number of vmas
 * per mm struct. Users can overwrite this number by sysctl but there is a
 * problem.
 *
 * When a program&apos;s coredump is generated as ELF format, a section is created
 * per a vma. In ELF, the number of sections is represented in unsigned short.
 * This means the number of sections should be smaller than 65535 at coredump.
 * Because the kernel adds some informative sections to a image of program at
 * generating coredump, we need some margin. The number of extra sections is
 * 1-3 now and depends on arch. We use &quot;5&quot; as safe margin, here.
 *
 * ELF extended numbering allows more than 65535 sections, so 16-bit bound is
 * not a hard limit any more. Although some userspace tools can be surprised by
 * that.
