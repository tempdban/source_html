 * DEFINE_DRM_GEM_FOPS() - macro to generate file operations for GEM drivers
 * @name: name for the generated structure
 *
 * This macro autogenerates a suitable &amp;struct file_operations for GEM based
 * drivers, which can be assigned to &amp;drm_driver.fops. Note that this structure
 * cannot be shared between drivers, because it contains a reference to the
 * current module using THIS_MODULE.
 *
 * Note that the declaration is already marked as static - if you need a
 * non-static version of this you&apos;re probably doing it wrong and will break the
 * THIS_MODULE reference by accident.
