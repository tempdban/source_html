 * This handles the memory map.

 * A __PAGE_OFFSET of 0xC0000000 means that the kernel has
 * a virtual address space of one gigabyte, which limits the
 * amount of physical memory you can use to about 950MB.
 *
 * If you want more physical memory than this then see the CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G
 * and CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G options in the kernel configuration.
