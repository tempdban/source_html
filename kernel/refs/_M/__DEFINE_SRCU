 * Define and initialize a srcu struct at build time.
 * Do -not- call init_srcu_struct() nor cleanup_srcu_struct() on it.
 *
 * Note that although DEFINE_STATIC_SRCU() hides the name from other
 * files, the per-CPU variable rules nevertheless require that the
 * chosen name be globally unique.  These rules also prohibit use of
 * DEFINE_STATIC_SRCU() within a function.  If these rules are too
 * restrictive, declare the srcu_struct manually.  For example, in
 * each file:
 *
 *	static struct srcu_struct my_srcu;
 *
 * Then, before the first use of each my_srcu, manually initialize it:
 *
 *	init_srcu_struct(&amp;my_srcu);
 *
 * See include/linux/percpu-defs.h for the rules on per-CPU variables.
