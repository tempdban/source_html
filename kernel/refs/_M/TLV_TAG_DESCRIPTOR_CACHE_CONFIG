 *
 * Sets the sizes of the TX and RX descriptor caches as a power of 2. It also
 * sets the total number of VIs. When the number of VIs is reduced VIs are taken
 * away from the highest numbered port first, so a vi_count of 1024 means 1024
 * VIs on the first port and 0 on the second (on a Torino).
