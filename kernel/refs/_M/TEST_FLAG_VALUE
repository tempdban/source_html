 * Since it&apos;s pretty easy to mix up bit numbers and hex values, we use a
 * build-time check to make sure that EXT4_XXX_FL is consistent with respect to
 * EXT4_INODE_XXX. If all is well, the macros will be dropped, so, it won&apos;t cost
 * any extra space in the compiled kernel image, otherwise, the build will fail.
 * It&apos;s important that these values are the same, since we are using
 * EXT4_INODE_XXX to test for flag values, but EXT4_XXX_FL must be consistent
 * with the values of FS_XXX_FL defined in include/linux/fs.h and the on-disk
 * values found in ext2, ext3 and ext4 filesystems, and of course the values
 * defined in e2fsprogs.
 *
 * It&apos;s not paranoia if the Murphy&apos;s Law really *is* out to get you.  :-)
