 * I915_CACHING_DISPLAY
 *
 * Special GPU caching mode which is coherent with the scanout engines.
 * Transparently falls back to I915_CACHING_NONE on platforms where no special
 * cache mode (like write-through or gfdt flushing) is available. The kernel
 * automatically sets this mode when using a buffer as a scanout target.
 * Userspace can manually set this mode to avoid a costly stall and clflush in
 * the hotpath of drawing the first frame.
