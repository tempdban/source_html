 * The length of circular buffer for queuing messages from a client.
 * &apos;msg_count&apos; tracks the number of buffered messages while &apos;msg_free&apos;
 * is the index where the next message would be buffered.
 * We shouldn&apos;t need it too big because every transfer is interrupt
 * triggered and if we have lots of data to transfer, the interrupt
 * latencies are going to be the bottleneck, not the buffer length.
 * Besides, mbox_send_message could be called from atomic context and
 * the client could also queue another message from the notifier &apos;tx_done&apos;
 * of the last transfer done.
 * REVISIT: If too many platforms see the &quot;Try increasing MBOX_TX_QUEUE_LEN&quot;
 * print, it needs to be taken from config option or somesuch.
