 * FC Local Port (Host) Attributes
 *
 * Attributes are based on HBAAPI V2.0 definitions.
 * Note: OSDeviceName is determined by user-space library
 *
 * Fixed attributes are not expected to change. The driver is
 * expected to set these values after successfully calling scsi_add_host().
 * The transport fully manages all get functions w/o driver interaction.
 *
 * Dynamic attributes are expected to change. The driver participates
 * in all get/set operations via functions provided by the driver.
 *
 * Private attributes are transport-managed values. They are fully
 * managed by the transport w/o driver interaction.
