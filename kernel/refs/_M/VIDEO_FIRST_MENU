 * This code uses an extended set of video mode numbers. These include:
 * Aliases for standard modes
 *      NORMAL_VGA (-1)
 *      EXTENDED_VGA (-2)
 *      ASK_VGA (-3)
 * Video modes numbered by menu position -- NOT RECOMMENDED because of lack
 * of compatibility when extending the table. These are between 0x00 and 0xff.
