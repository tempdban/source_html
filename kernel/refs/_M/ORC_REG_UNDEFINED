 * The ORC_REG_* registers are base registers which are used to find other
 * registers on the stack.
 *
 * ORC_REG_PREV_SP, also known as DWARF Call Frame Address (CFA), is the
 * address of the previous frame: the caller&apos;s SP before it called the current
 * function.
 *
 * ORC_REG_UNDEFINED means the corresponding register&apos;s value didn&apos;t change in
 * the current frame.
 *
 * The most commonly used base registers are SP and BP -- which the previous SP
 * is usually based on -- and PREV_SP and UNDEFINED -- which the previous BP is
 * usually based on.
 *
 * The rest of the base registers are needed for special cases like entry code
 * and GCC realigned stacks.
