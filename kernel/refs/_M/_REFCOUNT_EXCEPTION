 * This is the first portion of the refcount error handling, which lives in
 * .text.unlikely, and is jumped to from the CPU flag check (in the
 * following macros). This saves the refcount value location into CX for
 * the exception handler to use (in mm/extable.c), and then triggers the
 * central refcount exception. The fixup address for the exception points
 * back to the regular execution flow in .text.
