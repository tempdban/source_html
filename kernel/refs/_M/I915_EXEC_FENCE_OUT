<doc f='linux-4.14.y/include/uapi/drm/i915_drm.h' l='928'>/* Setting I915_EXEC_FENCE_OUT causes the ioctl to return a sync_file fd
 * in the upper_32_bits(rsvd2) upon success. Ownership of the fd is given
 * to the caller, and it should be close() after use. (The fd is a regular
 * file descriptor and will be cleaned up on process termination. It holds
 * a reference to the request, but nothing else.)
 *
 * The sync_file fd can be combined with other sync_file and passed either
 * to execbuf using I915_EXEC_FENCE_IN, to atomic KMS ioctls (so that a flip
 * will only occur after this request completes), or to other devices.
 *
 * Using I915_EXEC_FENCE_OUT requires use of
 * DRM_IOCTL_I915_GEM_EXECBUFFER2_WR ioctl so that the result is written
 * back to userspace. Failure to do so will cause the out-fence to always
 * be reported as zero, and the real fence fd to be leaked.
