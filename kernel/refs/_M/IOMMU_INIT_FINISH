 * A more sophisticated version of IOMMU_INIT. This variant requires:
 *  a). A detection routine function.
 *  b). The name of the detection routine we depend on to get called
 *      before us.
 *  c). The init routine which gets called if the detection routine
 *      returns a positive value from the pci_iommu_alloc. This means
 *      no presence of a memory allocator.
 *  d). Similar to the &apos;init&apos;, except that this gets called from pci_iommu_init
 *      where we do have a memory allocator.
 *
 * The standard IOMMU_INIT differs from the IOMMU_INIT_FINISH variant
 * in that the former will continue detecting other IOMMUs in the call
 * list after the detection routine returns a positive number, while the
 * latter will stop the execution chain upon first successful detection.
 * Both variants will still call the &apos;init&apos; and &apos;late_init&apos; functions if
 * they are set.
