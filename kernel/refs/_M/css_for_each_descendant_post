 * css_for_each_descendant_post - post-order walk of a css&apos;s descendants
 * @pos: the css * to use as the loop cursor
 * @css: css whose descendants to walk
 *
 * Similar to css_for_each_descendant_pre() but performs post-order
 * traversal instead.  @root is included in the iteration and the last
 * node to be visited.
 *
 * If a subsystem synchronizes -&gt;css_online() and the start of iteration, a
 * css which finished -&gt;css_online() is guaranteed to be visible in the
 * future iterations and will stay visible until the last reference is put.
 * A css which hasn&apos;t finished -&gt;css_online() or already finished
 * -&gt;css_offline() may show up during traversal.  It&apos;s each subsystem&apos;s
 * responsibility to synchronize against on/offlining.
 *
 * Note that the walk visibility guarantee example described in pre-order
 * walk doesn&apos;t apply the same to post-order walks.
