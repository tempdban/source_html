 * Fast allocation side cache array/stack
 *
 * The cache size and refill watermark is related to the network
 * use-case.  The NAPI budget is 64 packets.  After a NAPI poll the RX
 * ring is usually refilled and the max consumed elements will be 64,
 * thus a natural max size of objects needed in the cache.
 *
 * Keeping room for more objects, is due to XDP_DROP use-case.  As
 * XDP_DROP allows the opportunity to recycle objects directly into
 * this array, as it shares the same softirq/NAPI protection.  If
 * cache is already full (or partly full) then the XDP_DROP recycles
 * would have to take a slower code path.
