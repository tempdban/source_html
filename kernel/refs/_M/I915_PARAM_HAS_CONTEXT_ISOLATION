 * Query whether every context (both per-file default and user created) is
 * isolated (insofar as HW supports). If this parameter is not true, then
 * freshly created contexts may inherit values from an existing context,
 * rather than default HW values. If true, it also ensures (insofar as HW
 * supports) that all state set by this context will not leak to any other
 * context.
 *
 * As not every engine across every gen support contexts, the returned
 * value reports the support of context isolation for individual engines by
 * returning a bitmask of each engine class set to true if that class supports
 * isolation.
