 * Enable data capture for a stream that was either opened in a disabled state
 * via I915_PERF_FLAG_DISABLED or was later disabled via

 * It is intended to be cheaper to disable and enable a stream than it may be
 * to close and re-open a stream with the same configuration.
 *
 * It&apos;s undefined whether any pending data for the stream will be lost.
