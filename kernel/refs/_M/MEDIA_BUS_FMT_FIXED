 * These bus formats uniquely identify data formats on the data bus. Format 0
 * is reserved, MEDIA_BUS_FMT_FIXED shall be used by host-client pairs, where
 * the data format is fixed. Additionally, &quot;2X8&quot; means that one pixel is
 * transferred in two 8-bit samples, &quot;BE&quot; or &quot;LE&quot; specify in which order those
 * samples are transferred over the bus: &quot;LE&quot; means that the least significant
 * bits are transferred first, &quot;BE&quot; means that the most significant bits are
 * transferred first, and &quot;PADHI&quot; and &quot;PADLO&quot; define which bits - low or high,
 * in the incomplete high byte, are filled with padding bits.
 *
 * The bus formats are grouped by type, bus_width, bits per component, samples
 * per pixel and order of subsamples. Numerical values are sorted using generic
 * numerical sort order (8 thus comes before 10).
 *
 * As their value can&apos;t change when a new bus format is inserted in the
 * enumeration, the bus formats are explicitly given a numerical value. The next
 * free values for each category are listed below, update them when inserting
 * new pixel codes.
