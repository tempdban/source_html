 * SHMMNI, SHMMAX and SHMALL are default upper limits which can be
 * modified by sysctl. The SHMMAX and SHMALL values have been chosen to
 * be as large possible without facilitating scenarios where userspace
 * causes overflows when adjusting the limits via operations of the form
 * &quot;retrieve current limit; add X; update limit&quot;. It is therefore not
 * advised to make SHMMAX and SHMALL any larger. These limits are
 * suitable for both 32 and 64-bit systems.
