 * PATCH_RAW - Auxiliary command to resolve self referential code
 * @program: buffer to be updated (struct program *)
 * @line: position in descriptor buffer where the update will be done; this
 *        value is previously retained in program flow using a reference near
 *        the sequence to be modified.
 * @mask: mask to be used for applying the new value (unsigned int). The mask
 *        selects which bits from the provided @new_val are taken into
 *        consideration when overwriting the existing value.
 * @new_val: updated value that will be masked using the provided mask value
 *           and inserted in descriptor buffer at the specified line.
 *
 * Return: 0 in case of success, a negative error code if it fails
