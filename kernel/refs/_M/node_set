 * The inline keyword gives the compiler room to decide to inline, or
 * not inline a function as it sees best.  However, as these functions
 * are called in both __init and non-__init functions, if they are not
 * inlined we will end up with a section mis-match error (of the type of
 * freeable items not being freed).  So we must use __always_inline here
 * to fix the problem.  If other functions in the future also end up in
 * this situation they will also need to be annotated as __always_inline
