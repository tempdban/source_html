 * drm_mm_for_each_node_in_range - iterator to walk over a range of
 * allocated nodes
 * @node__: drm_mm_node structure to assign to in each iteration step
 * @mm__: drm_mm allocator to walk
 * @start__: starting offset, the first node will overlap this
 * @end__: ending offset, the last node will start before this (but may overlap)
 *
 * This iterator walks over all nodes in the range allocator that lie
 * between @start and @end. It is implemented similarly to list_for_each(),
 * but using the internal interval tree to accelerate the search for the
 * starting node, and so not safe against removal of elements. It assumes
 * that @end is within (or is the upper limit of) the drm_mm allocator.
 * If [@start, @end] are beyond the range of the drm_mm, the iterator may walk
 * over the special _unallocated_ &amp;drm_mm.head_node, and may even continue
 * indefinitely.
