	 * This value is the number of additional buffers in the ring that
	 * describe the buffer space to be consumed for the this packet.
	 * If the value is zero, then the packet must fit within the
	 * space described by this BD.  If this value is 1 or more, it
	 * indicates how many additional &quot;buffer&quot; BDs are in the ring

	 * Even if the packet to be placed does not need all the
	 * additional buffers, they will be consumed anyway.
