 * Change timeval to jiffies, trying to avoid the
 * most obvious overflows..
 *
 * And some not so obvious.
 *
 * Note that we don&apos;t want to return LONG_MAX, because
 * for various timeout reasons we often end up having
 * to wait &quot;jiffies+1&quot; in order to guarantee that we wait
 * at _least_ &quot;jiffies&quot; - so &quot;jiffies+1&quot; had better still
 * be positive.
