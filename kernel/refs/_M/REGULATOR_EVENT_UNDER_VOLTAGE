 * Regulator notifier events.
 *
 * UNDER_VOLTAGE  Regulator output is under voltage.
 * OVER_CURRENT   Regulator output current is too high.
 * REGULATION_OUT Regulator output is out of regulation.
 * FAIL           Regulator output has failed.
 * OVER_TEMP      Regulator over temp.
 * FORCE_DISABLE  Regulator forcibly shut down by software.
 * VOLTAGE_CHANGE Regulator voltage changed.
 *                Data passed is old voltage cast to (void *).
 * DISABLE        Regulator was disabled.
 * PRE_VOLTAGE_CHANGE   Regulator is about to have voltage changed.
 *                      Data passed is &quot;struct pre_voltage_change_data&quot;
 * ABORT_VOLTAGE_CHANGE Regulator voltage change failed for some reason.
 *                      Data passed is old voltage cast to (void *).
 * PRE_DISABLE    Regulator is about to be disabled
 * ABORT_DISABLE  Regulator disable failed for some reason
