 * rcu_dereference_check() - rcu_dereference with debug checking
 * @p: The pointer to read, prior to dereferencing
 * @c: The conditions under which the dereference will take place
 *
 * Do an rcu_dereference(), but check that the conditions under which the
 * dereference will take place are correct.  Typically the conditions
 * indicate the various locking conditions that should be held at that
 * point.  The check should return true if the conditions are satisfied.
 * An implicit check for being in an RCU read-side critical section
 * (rcu_read_lock()) is included.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 *	bar = rcu_dereference_check(foo-&gt;bar, lockdep_is_held(&amp;foo-&gt;lock));
 *
 * could be used to indicate to lockdep that foo-&gt;bar may only be dereferenced
 * if either rcu_read_lock() is held, or that the lock required to replace
 * the bar struct at foo-&gt;bar is held.
 *
 * Note that the list of conditions may also include indications of when a lock
 * need not be held, for example during initialisation or destruction of the
 * target struct:
 *
 *	bar = rcu_dereference_check(foo-&gt;bar, lockdep_is_held(&amp;foo-&gt;lock) ||
 *					      atomic_read(&amp;foo-&gt;usage) == 0);
 *
 * Inserts memory barriers on architectures that require them
 * (currently only the Alpha), prevents the compiler from refetching
 * (and from merging fetches), and, more importantly, documents exactly
 * which pointers are protected by RCU and checks that the pointer is
 * annotated as __rcu.
