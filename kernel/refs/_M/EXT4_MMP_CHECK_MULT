 * Check interval multiplier
 * The MMP block is written every update interval and initially checked every
 * update interval x the multiplier (the value is then adapted based on the
 * write latency). The reason is that writes can be delayed under load and we
 * don&apos;t want readers to incorrectly assume that the filesystem is no longer
 * in use.
