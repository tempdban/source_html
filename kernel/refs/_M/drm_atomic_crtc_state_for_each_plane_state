 * drm_crtc_atomic_state_for_each_plane_state - iterate over attached planes in new state
 * @plane: the loop cursor
 * @plane_state: loop cursor for the plane&apos;s state, must be const
 * @crtc_state: the incoming crtc-state
 *
 * Similar to drm_crtc_for_each_plane(), but iterates the planes that will be
 * attached if the specified state is applied.  Useful during for example
 * in code called from &amp;drm_mode_config_funcs.atomic_check operations, to
 * validate the incoming state.
 *
 * Compared to just drm_atomic_crtc_state_for_each_plane() this also fills in a
 * const plane_state. This is useful when a driver just wants to peek at other
 * active planes on this crtc, but does not need to change it.
