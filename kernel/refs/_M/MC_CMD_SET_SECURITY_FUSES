 * Change the security level of the adapter by setting bits in the write-once
 * memory. The firmware maps each flag in the message to a set of one or more
 * hardware-defined or software-defined bits and sets these bits in the write-
 * once memory. For Medford the hardware-defined bits are defined in
 * SF-112079-PS 5.3, the software-defined bits are defined in xpm.h. Returns 0
 * if all of the required bits were set and returns MC_CMD_ERR_EIO if any of
 * the required bits were not set.
