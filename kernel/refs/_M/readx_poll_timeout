 * readx_poll_timeout - Periodically poll an address until a condition is met or a timeout occurs
 * @op: accessor function (takes @addr as its only argument)
 * @addr: Address to poll
 * @val: Variable to read the value into
 * @cond: Break condition (usually involving @val)
 * @sleep_us: Maximum time to sleep between reads in us (0
 *            tight-loops).  Should be less than ~20ms since usleep_range
 *            is used (see Documentation/timers/timers-howto.txt).
 * @timeout_us: Timeout in us, 0 means never timeout
 *
 * Returns 0 on success and -ETIMEDOUT upon a timeout. In either
 * case, the last read value at @addr is stored in @val. Must not
 * be called from atomic context if sleep_us or timeout_us are used.
 *
 * When available, you&apos;ll probably want to use one of the specialized
 * macros defined below rather than this macro directly.
