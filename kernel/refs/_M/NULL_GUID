 * EFI Configuration Table and GUID definitions

 * Here&apos;s how they are structured:

 * GUID: 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
 * Spec:
 *      #define EFI_SOME_PROTOCOL_GUID \

 *          {0x12,0x34,0x12,0x34,0x56,0x78,0x90,0x12}}
 * Here:
 *	#define SOME_PROTOCOL_GUID		EFI_GUID(0x12345678, 0x1234, 0x1234,  0x12, 0x34, 0x12, 0x34, 0x56, 0x78, 0x90, 0x12)
 *					^ tabs					    ^extra space
 *
 * Note that the &apos;extra space&apos; separates the values at the same place
 * where the UEFI SPEC breaks the line.
