 * For PM1 control, the SCI enable bit (bit 0, SCI_EN) is defined by the
 * ACPI specification to be a &quot;preserved&quot; bit - &quot;OSPM always preserves this
 * bit position&quot;, section 4.7.3.2.1. However, on some machines the OS must
 * write a one to this bit after resume for the machine to work properly.
 * To enable this, we no longer attempt to preserve this bit. No machines
 * are known to fail if the bit is not preserved. (May 2009)
