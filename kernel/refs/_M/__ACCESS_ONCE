 * Prevent the compiler from merging or refetching accesses.  The compiler
 * is also forbidden from reordering successive instances of ACCESS_ONCE(),
 * but only when the compiler is aware of some particular ordering.  One way
 * to make the compiler aware of ordering is to put the two invocations of
 * ACCESS_ONCE() in different C statements.
 *
 * ACCESS_ONCE will only work on scalar types. For union types, ACCESS_ONCE
 * on a union member will work as long as the size of the member matches the
 * size of the union and the size is smaller than word size.
 *
 * The major use cases of ACCESS_ONCE used to be (1) Mediating communication
 * between process-level code and irq/NMI handlers, all running on the same CPU,
 * and (2) Ensuring that the compiler does not  fold, spindle, or otherwise
 * mutilate accesses that either do not require ordering or that interact
 * with an explicit memory barrier or atomic instruction that provides the
 * required ordering.
 *
 * If possible use READ_ONCE()/WRITE_ONCE() instead.
