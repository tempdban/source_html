 * The run state of the lockup detectors is controlled by the content of the
 * &apos;watchdog_enabled&apos; variable. Each lockup detector has its dedicated bit -
 * bit 0 for the hard lockup detector and bit 1 for the soft lockup detector.
 *
 * &apos;watchdog_user_enabled&apos;, &apos;nmi_watchdog_user_enabled&apos; and
 * &apos;soft_watchdog_user_enabled&apos; are variables that are only used as an
 * &apos;interface&apos; between the parameters in /proc/sys/kernel and the internal
 * state bits in &apos;watchdog_enabled&apos;. The &apos;watchdog_thresh&apos; variable is
 * handled differently because its value is not boolean, and the lockup
 * detectors are &apos;suspended&apos; while &apos;watchdog_thresh&apos; is equal zero.
