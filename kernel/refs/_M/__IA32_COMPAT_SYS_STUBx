 * For IA32 emulation, we need to handle &quot;compat&quot; syscalls *and* create
 * additional wrappers (aptly named __ia32_sys_xyzzy) which decode the
 * ia32 regs in the proper order for shared or &quot;common&quot; syscalls. As some
 * syscalls may not be implemented, we need to expand COND_SYSCALL in
 * kernel/sys_ni.c and SYS_NI in kernel/time/posix-stubs.c to cover this
 * case as well.
