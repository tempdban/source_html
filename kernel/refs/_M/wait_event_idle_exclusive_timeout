 * wait_event_idle_exclusive_timeout - sleep without load until a condition becomes true or a timeout elapses
 * @wq_head: the waitqueue to wait on
 * @condition: a C expression for the event to wait for
 * @timeout: timeout, in jiffies
 *
 * The process is put to sleep (TASK_IDLE) until the
 * @condition evaluates to true. The @condition is checked each time
 * the waitqueue @wq_head is woken up.
 *
 * The process is put on the wait queue with an WQ_FLAG_EXCLUSIVE flag
 * set thus if other processes wait on the same list, when this
 * process is woken further processes are not considered.
 *
 * wake_up() has to be called after changing any variable that could
 * change the result of the wait condition.
 *
 * Returns:
 * 0 if the @condition evaluated to %false after the @timeout elapsed,
 * 1 if the @condition evaluated to %true after the @timeout elapsed,
 * or the remaining jiffies (at least 1) if the @condition evaluated
 * to %true before the @timeout elapsed.
