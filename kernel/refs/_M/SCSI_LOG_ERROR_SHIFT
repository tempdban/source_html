 * This defines the scsi logging feature.  It is a means by which the user
 * can select how much information they get about various goings on, and it
 * can be really useful for fault tracing.  The logging word is divided into
 * 8 nibbles, each of which describes a loglevel.  The division of things is
 * somewhat arbitrary, and the division of the word could be changed if it
 * were really needed for any reason.  The numbers below are the only place
 * where these are specified.  For a first go-around, 3 bits is more than
 * enough, since this gives 8 levels of logging (really 7, since 0 is always
 * off).  Cutting to 2 bits might be wise at some point.
