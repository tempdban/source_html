 * wait_event_interruptible_lock_irq_timeout - sleep until a condition gets
 *		true or a timeout elapses. The condition is checked under
 *		the lock. This is expected to be called with the lock taken.
 * @wq_head: the waitqueue to wait on
 * @condition: a C expression for the event to wait for
 * @lock: a locked spinlock_t, which will be released before schedule()
 *	  and reacquired afterwards.
 * @timeout: timeout, in jiffies
 *
 * The process is put to sleep (TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE) until the
 * @condition evaluates to true or signal is received. The @condition is
 * checked each time the waitqueue @wq_head is woken up.
 *
 * wake_up() has to be called after changing any variable that could
 * change the result of the wait condition.
 *
 * This is supposed to be called while holding the lock. The lock is
 * dropped before going to sleep and is reacquired afterwards.
 *
 * The function returns 0 if the @timeout elapsed, -ERESTARTSYS if it
 * was interrupted by a signal, and the remaining jiffies otherwise
 * if the condition evaluated to true before the timeout elapsed.
