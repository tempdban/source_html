   parser receiving this key returns success, the fact is recorded, and the
   ARGP_KEY_NO_ARGS case won&apos;t be used.  HOWEVER, if while processing the
   argument, a parser function decrements the NEXT field of the state it&apos;s
   passed, the option won&apos;t be considered processed; this is to allow you to
   actually modify the argument (perhaps into an option), and have it
   processed again.  */</doc>
