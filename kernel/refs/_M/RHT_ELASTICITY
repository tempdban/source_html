 *
 * The maximum (not average) chain length grows with the size of the hash
 * table, at a rate of (log N)/(log log N).
 *
 * The value of 16 is selected so that even if the hash table grew to
 * 2^32 you would not expect the maximum chain length to exceed it
 * unless we are under attack (or extremely unlucky).
 *
 * As this limit is only to detect attacks, we don&apos;t need to set it to a
 * lower value as you&apos;d need the chain length to vastly exceed 16 to have
 * any real effect on the system.
