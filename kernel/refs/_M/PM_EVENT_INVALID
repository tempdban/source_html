 * PM_EVENT_ messages
 *
 * The following PM_EVENT_ messages are defined for the internal use of the PM
 * core, in order to provide a mechanism allowing the high level suspend and
 * hibernation code to convey the necessary information to the device PM core
 * code:
 *
 * ON		No transition.
 *
 * FREEZE	System is going to hibernate, call -&gt;prepare() and -&gt;freeze()
 *		for all devices.
 *
 * SUSPEND	System is going to suspend, call -&gt;prepare() and -&gt;suspend()
 *		for all devices.
 *
 * HIBERNATE	Hibernation image has been saved, call -&gt;prepare() and
 *		-&gt;poweroff() for all devices.
 *
 * QUIESCE	Contents of main memory are going to be restored from a (loaded)
 *		hibernation image, call -&gt;prepare() and -&gt;freeze() for all
 *		devices.
 *
 * RESUME	System is resuming, call -&gt;resume() and -&gt;complete() for all
 *		devices.
 *
 * THAW		Hibernation image has been created, call -&gt;thaw() and
 *		-&gt;complete() for all devices.
 *
 * RESTORE	Contents of main memory have been restored from a hibernation
 *		image, call -&gt;restore() and -&gt;complete() for all devices.
 *
 * RECOVER	Creation of a hibernation image or restoration of the main
 *		memory contents from a hibernation image has failed, call
 *		-&gt;thaw() and -&gt;complete() for all devices.
 *
 * The following PM_EVENT_ messages are defined for internal use by
 * kernel subsystems.  They are never issued by the PM core.
 *
 * USER_SUSPEND		Manual selective suspend was issued by userspace.
 *
 * USER_RESUME		Manual selective resume was issued by userspace.
 *
 * REMOTE_WAKEUP	Remote-wakeup request was received from the device.
 *
 * AUTO_SUSPEND		Automatic (device idle) runtime suspend was
 *			initiated by the subsystem.
 *
 * AUTO_RESUME		Automatic (device needed) runtime resume was
 *			requested by a driver.
