<doc f='linux-4.18.y/include/uapi/linux/netfilter_bridge/ebtables.h' l='95'>/* This is a hack to make a difference between an ebt_entry struct and an
 * ebt_entries struct when traversing the entries from start to end.
 * Using this simplifies the code a lot, while still being able to use
 * ebt_entries.
 * Contrary, iptables doesn&apos;t use something like ebt_entries and therefore uses
 * different techniques for naming the policy and such. So, iptables doesn&apos;t
 * need a hack like this.
