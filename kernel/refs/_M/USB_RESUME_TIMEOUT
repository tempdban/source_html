 * USB Resume Timer: Every Host controller driver should drive the resume
 * signalling on the bus for the amount of time defined by this macro.
 *
 * That way we will have a &apos;stable&apos; behavior among all HCDs supported by Linux.
 *
 * Note that the USB Specification states we should drive resume for *at least*
 * 20 ms, but it doesn&apos;t give an upper bound. This creates two possible
 * situations which we want to avoid:
 *
 * (a) sometimes an msleep(20) might expire slightly before 20 ms, which causes
 * us to fail USB Electrical Tests, thus failing Certification
 *
 * (b) Some (many) devices actually need more than 20 ms of resume signalling,
 * and while we can argue that&apos;s against the USB Specification, we don&apos;t have
 * control over which devices a certification laboratory will be using for
 * certification. If CertLab uses a device which was tested against Windows and
 * that happens to have relaxed resume signalling rules, we might fall into
 * situations where we fail interoperability and electrical tests.
 *
 * In order to avoid both conditions, we&apos;re using a 40 ms resume timeout, which
 * should cope with both LPJ calibration errors and devices not following every
 * detail of the USB Specification.
