 * All commands from userspace should start with a __u32 command field
 * followed by __u16 in_words and out_words fields (which give the
 * length of the command block and response buffer if any in 32-bit
 * words).  The kernel driver will read these fields first and read
 * the rest of the command struct based on these value.
