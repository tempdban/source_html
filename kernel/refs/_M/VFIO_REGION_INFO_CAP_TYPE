 * The device specific type capability allows regions unique to a specific
 * device or class of devices to be exposed.  This helps solve the problem for
 * vfio bus drivers of defining which region indexes correspond to which region
 * on the device, without needing to resort to static indexes, as done by
 * vfio-pci.  For instance, if we were to go back in time, we might remove
 * VFIO_PCI_VGA_REGION_INDEX and let vfio-pci simply define that all indexes
 * greater than or equal to VFIO_PCI_NUM_REGIONS are device specific and we&apos;d
 * make a &quot;VGA&quot; device specific type to describe the VGA access space.  This
 * means that non-VGA devices wouldn&apos;t need to waste this index, and thus the
 * address space associated with it due to implementation of device file
 * descriptor offsets in vfio-pci.
 *
 * The current implementation is now part of the user ABI, so we can&apos;t use this
 * for VGA, but there are other upcoming use cases, such as opregions for Intel
 * IGD devices and framebuffers for vGPU devices.  We missed VGA, but we&apos;ll
 * use this for future additions.
 *
 * The structure below defines version 1 of this capability.
