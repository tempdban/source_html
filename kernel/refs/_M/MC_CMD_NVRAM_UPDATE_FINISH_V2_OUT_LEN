 *
 * Extended NVRAM_UPDATE_FINISH response that communicates the result of secure
 * firmware validation where applicable back to the host.
 *
 * Medford only: For signed firmware images, such as those for medford, the MC
 * firmware verifies the signature before marking the firmware image as valid.
 * This process takes a few seconds to complete. So is likely to take more than
 * the MCDI timeout. Hence signature verification is initiated when
 * MC_CMD_NVRAM_UPDATE_FINISH_V2_IN is received by the firmware, however, the
 * MCDI command is run in a background MCDI processing thread. This response
 * payload includes the results of the signature verification. Note that the
 * per-partition nvram lock in firmware is only released after the verification
 * has completed.
