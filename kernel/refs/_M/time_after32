 * time_after32 - compare two 32-bit relative times
 * @a:	the time which may be after @b
 * @b:	the time which may be before @a

 * time_after32(a, b) returns true if the time @a is after time @b.

 * Similar to time_after(), compare two 32-bit timestamps for relative
 * times.  This is useful for comparing 32-bit seconds values that can&apos;t
 * be converted to 64-bit values (e.g. due to disk format or wire protocol
 * issues) when it is known that the times are less than 68 years apart.
