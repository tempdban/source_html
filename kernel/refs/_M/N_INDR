   an indirect reference to another symbol.  The other symbol
   appears as an undefined reference, immediately following this symbol.

   Indirection is asymmetrical.  The other symbol&apos;s value will be used

   If the other symbol does not have a definition, libraries will
   be searched to find a definition.  */</doc>
