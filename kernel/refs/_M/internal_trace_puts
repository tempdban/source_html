 * Normal trace_printk() and friends allocates special buffers
 * to do the manipulation, as well as saves the print formats
 * into sections to display. But the trace infrastructure wants
 * to use these without the added overhead at the price of being
 * a bit slower (used mainly for warnings, where we don&apos;t care
 * about performance). The internal_trace_puts() is for such
 * a purpose.
