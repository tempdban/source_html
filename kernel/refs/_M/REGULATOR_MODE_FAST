 * Regulator operating modes.
 *
 * Regulators can run in a variety of different operating modes depending on
 * output load. This allows further system power savings by selecting the
 * best (and most efficient) regulator mode for a desired load.
 *
 * Most drivers will only care about NORMAL. The modes below are generic and
 * will probably not match the naming convention of your regulator data sheet
 * but should match the use cases in the datasheet.
 *
 * In order of power efficiency (least efficient at top).
 *
 *  Mode       Description
 *  FAST       Regulator can handle fast changes in it&apos;s load.
 *             e.g. useful in CPU voltage &amp; frequency scaling where
 *             load can quickly increase with CPU frequency increases.
 *
 *  NORMAL     Normal regulator power supply mode. Most drivers will
 *             use this mode.
 *
 *  IDLE       Regulator runs in a more efficient mode for light
 *             loads. Can be used for devices that have a low power
 *             requirement during periods of inactivity. This mode
 *             may be more noisy than NORMAL and may not be able
 *             to handle fast load switching.
 *
 *  STANDBY    Regulator runs in the most efficient mode for very
 *             light loads. Can be used by devices when they are
 *             in a sleep/standby state. This mode is likely to be
 *             the most noisy and may not be able to handle fast load
 *             switching.
 *
 * NOTE: Most regulators will only support a subset of these modes. Some
 * will only just support NORMAL.
 *
 * These modes can be OR&apos;ed together to make up a mask of valid register modes.
