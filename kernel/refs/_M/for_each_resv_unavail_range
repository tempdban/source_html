 * for_each_resv_unavail_range - iterate through reserved and unavailable memory
 * @i: u64 used as loop variable
 * @flags: pick from blocks based on memory attributes
 * @p_start: ptr to phys_addr_t for start address of the range, can be %NULL
 * @p_end: ptr to phys_addr_t for end address of the range, can be %NULL
 *
 * Walks over unavailable but reserved (reserved &amp;&amp; !memory) areas of memblock.
 * Available as soon as memblock is initialized.
 * Note: because this memory does not belong to any physical node, flags and
 * nid arguments do not make sense and thus not exported as arguments.
