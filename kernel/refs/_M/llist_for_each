 * llist_for_each - iterate over some deleted entries of a lock-less list
 * @pos:	the &amp;struct llist_node to use as a loop cursor
 * @node:	the first entry of deleted list entries
 *
 * In general, some entries of the lock-less list can be traversed
 * safely only after being deleted from list, so start with an entry
 * instead of list head.
 *
 * If being used on entries deleted from lock-less list directly, the
 * traverse order is from the newest to the oldest added entry.  If
 * you want to traverse from the oldest to the newest, you must
 * reverse the order by yourself before traversing.
