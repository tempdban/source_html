 * Only the _current_ task can read/write to tsk-&gt;flags, but other
 * tasks can access tsk-&gt;flags in readonly mode for example
 * with tsk_used_math (like during threaded core dumping).
 * There is however an exception to this rule during ptrace
 * or during fork: the ptracer task is allowed to write to the
 * child-&gt;flags of its traced child (same goes for fork, the parent
 * can write to the child-&gt;flags), because we&apos;re guaranteed the
 * child is not running and in turn not changing child-&gt;flags
 * at the same time the parent does it.
