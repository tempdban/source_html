 * Process-level increment to -&gt;dynticks_nesting field.  This allows for
 * architectures that use half-interrupts and half-exceptions from
 * process context.
 *
 * DYNTICK_TASK_NEST_MASK defines a field of width DYNTICK_TASK_NEST_WIDTH
 * that counts the number of process-based reasons why RCU cannot
 * consider the corresponding CPU to be idle, and DYNTICK_TASK_NEST_VALUE
 * is the value used to increment or decrement this field.
 *
 * The rest of the bits could in principle be used to count interrupts,
 * but this would mean that a negative-one value in the interrupt
 * field could incorrectly zero out the DYNTICK_TASK_NEST_MASK field.
 * We therefore provide a two-bit guard field defined by DYNTICK_TASK_MASK
 * that is set to DYNTICK_TASK_FLAG upon initial exit from idle.
 * The DYNTICK_TASK_EXIT_IDLE value is thus the combined value used upon
 * initial exit from idle.
