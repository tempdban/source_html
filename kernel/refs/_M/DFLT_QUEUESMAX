 * POSIX Message Queue default values:
 *
 * MIN_*: Lowest value an admin can set the maximum unprivileged limit to
 * DFLT_*MAX: Default values for the maximum unprivileged limits
 * DFLT_{MSG,MSGSIZE}: Default values used when the user doesn&apos;t supply
 *   an attribute to the open call and the queue must be created
 * HARD_*: Highest value the maximums can be set to.  These are enforced
 *   on CAP_SYS_RESOURCE apps as well making them inviolate (so make them
 *   suitably high)
 *
 * POSIX Requirements:
 *   Per app minimum openable message queues - 8.  This does not map well
 *     to the fact that we limit the number of queues on a per namespace
 *     basis instead of a per app basis.  So, make the default high enough
 *     that no given app should have a hard time opening 8 queues.
 *   Minimum maximum for HARD_MSGMAX - 32767.  I bumped this to 65536.
 *   Minimum maximum for HARD_MSGSIZEMAX - POSIX is silent on this.  However,
 *     we have run into a situation where running applications in the wild
 *     require this to be at least 5MB, and preferably 10MB, so I set the
 *     value to 16MB in hopes that this user is the worst of the bunch and
 *     the new maximum will handle anyone else.  I may have to revisit this
 *     in the future.
