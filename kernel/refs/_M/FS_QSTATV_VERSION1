 * fs_quota_statv is used by Q_XGETQSTATV for a given file system. It provides
 * a centralized way to get meta information about the quota subsystem. eg.
 * space taken up for user, group, and project quotas, number of dquots
 * currently incore.
 *
 * This version has proper versioning support with appropriate padding for
 * future expansions, and ability to expand for future without creating any
 * backward compatibility issues.
 *
 * Q_XGETQSTATV uses the passed in value of the requested version via
 * fs_quota_statv.qs_version to determine the return data layout of
 * fs_quota_statv.  The kernel will fill the data fields relevant to that
 * version.
 *
 * If kernel does not support user space caller specified version, EINVAL will
 * be returned. User space caller can then reduce the version number and retry
 * the same command.
