 * lockless_dereference() - safely load a pointer for later dereference
 * @p: The pointer to load
 *
 * Similar to rcu_dereference(), but for situations where the pointed-to
 * object&apos;s lifetime is managed by something other than RCU.  That
 * &quot;something other&quot; might be reference counting or simple immortality.
 *
 * The seemingly unused variable ___typecheck_p validates that @p is
 * indeed a pointer type by using a pointer to typeof(*p) as the type.
 * Taking a pointer to typeof(*p) again is needed in case p is void *.
