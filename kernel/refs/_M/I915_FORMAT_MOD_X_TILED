 * Intel X-tiling layout

 * This is a tiled layout using 4Kb tiles (except on gen2 where the tiles 2Kb)
 * in row-major layout. Within the tile bytes are laid out row-major, with
 * a platform-dependent stride. On top of that the memory can apply
 * platform-depending swizzling of some higher address bits into bit6.
 *
 * This format is highly platforms specific and not useful for cross-driver
 * sharing. It exists since on a given platform it does uniquely identify the
 * layout in a simple way for i915-specific userspace.
