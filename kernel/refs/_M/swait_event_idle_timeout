 * swait_event_idle_timeout - wait up to timeout without load contribution
 * @wq: the waitqueue to wait on
 * @condition: a C expression for the event to wait for
 * @timeout: timeout at which we&apos;ll give up in jiffies
 *
 * The process is put to sleep (TASK_IDLE) until the @condition evaluates to
 * true. The @condition is checked each time the waitqueue @wq is woken up.
 *
 * This function is mostly used when a kthread or workqueue waits for some
 * condition and doesn&apos;t want to contribute to system load. Signals are
 * ignored.
 *
 * Returns:
 * 0 if the @condition evaluated to %false after the @timeout elapsed,
 * 1 if the @condition evaluated to %true after the @timeout elapsed,
 * or the remaining jiffies (at least 1) if the @condition evaluated
 * to %true before the @timeout elapsed.
