 * DRM_VMW_FENCE_WAIT
 *
 * Waits for a fence object to signal. The wait is interruptible, so that
 * signals may be delivered during the interrupt. The wait may timeout,
 * in which case the calls returns -EBUSY. If the wait is restarted,
 * that is restarting without resetting @cookie_valid to zero,
 * the timeout is computed from the first call.
 *
 * The flags argument to the DRM_VMW_FENCE_WAIT ioctl indicates what to wait
 * on:
 * DRM_VMW_FENCE_FLAG_EXEC: All commands ahead of the fence in the command
 * stream
 * have executed.
 * DRM_VMW_FENCE_FLAG_QUERY: All query results resulting from query finish
 * commands
 * in the buffer given to the EXECBUF ioctl returning the fence object handle
 * are available to user-space.
 *
 * DRM_VMW_WAIT_OPTION_UNREF: If this wait option is given, and the
 * fenc wait ioctl returns 0, the fence object has been unreferenced after
 * the wait.
