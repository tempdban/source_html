 * PERCPU_VADDR - define output section for percpu area
 * @cacheline: cacheline size
 * @vaddr: explicit base address (optional)
 * @phdr: destination PHDR (optional)
 *
 * Macro which expands to output section for percpu area.
 *
 * @cacheline is used to align subsections to avoid false cacheline
 * sharing between subsections for different purposes.
 *
 * If @vaddr is not blank, it specifies explicit base address and all
 * percpu symbols will be offset from the given address.  If blank,
 * @vaddr always equals @laddr + LOAD_OFFSET.
 *
 * @phdr defines the output PHDR to use if not blank.  Be warned that
 * output PHDR is sticky.  If @phdr is specified, the next output
 * section in the linker script will go there too.  @phdr should have
 * a leading colon.
 *
 * Note that this macros defines __per_cpu_load as an absolute symbol.
 * If there is no need to put the percpu section at a predetermined
 * address, use PERCPU_SECTION.
