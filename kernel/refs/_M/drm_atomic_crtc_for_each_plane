 * drm_atomic_crtc_for_each_plane - iterate over planes currently attached to CRTC
 * @plane: the loop cursor
 * @crtc:  the crtc whose planes are iterated
 *
 * This iterates over the current state, useful (for example) when applying
 * atomic state after it has been checked and swapped.  To iterate over the
 * planes which *will* be attached (more useful in code called from
 * &amp;drm_mode_config_funcs.atomic_check) see
 * drm_atomic_crtc_state_for_each_plane().
