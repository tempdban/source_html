 * We use the lower bits of the mem_map pointer to store
 * a little bit of information.  The pointer is calculated
 * as mem_map - section_nr_to_pfn(pnum).  The result is
 * aligned to the minimum alignment of the two values:
 *   1. All mem_map arrays are page-aligned.
 *   2. section_nr_to_pfn() always clears PFN_SECTION_SHIFT
 *      lowest bits.  PFN_SECTION_SHIFT is arch-specific
 *      (equal SECTION_SIZE_BITS - PAGE_SHIFT), and the
 *      worst combination is powerpc with 256k pages,
 *      which results in PFN_SECTION_SHIFT equal 6.
 * To sum it up, at least 6 bits are available.
