 * drm_mm_for_each_hole - iterator to walk over all holes
 * @pos: &amp;drm_mm_node used internally to track progress
 * @mm: &amp;drm_mm allocator to walk
 * @hole_start: ulong variable to assign the hole start to on each iteration
 * @hole_end: ulong variable to assign the hole end to on each iteration
 *
 * This iterator walks over all holes in the range allocator. It is implemented
 * with list_for_each(), so not save against removal of elements. @entry is used
 * internally and will not reflect a real drm_mm_node for the very first hole.
 * Hence users of this iterator may not access it.
 *
 * Implementation Note:
 * We need to inline list_for_each_entry in order to be able to set hole_start
 * and hole_end on each iteration while keeping the macro sane.
