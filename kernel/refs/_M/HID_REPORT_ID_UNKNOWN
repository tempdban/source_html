 * report_id.  Set report_id to REPORT_ID_UNKNOWN if the rest of the fields 
 * are unknown.  Otherwise use a usage_ref struct filled in from a previous 
 * successful GUSAGE call to save time.  To actually send a value to the
 * device, perform a SUSAGE first, followed by a SREPORT.  An INITREPORT or a
 * GREPORT isn&apos;t necessary for a GUSAGE to return valid data.
