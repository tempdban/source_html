 * This iterates over all connectors in an atomic update. Note that before the
 * software state is committed (by calling drm_atomic_helper_swap_state(), this
 * points to the new state, while afterwards it points to the old state. Due to
 * this tricky confusion this macro is deprecated.
 *
 * FIXME:
 *
 * Replace all usage of this with one of the explicit iterators below and then
 * remove this macro.
