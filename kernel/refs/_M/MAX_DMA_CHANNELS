 * NOTES about DMA transfers:
 *
 *  controller 1: channels 0-3, byte operations, ports 00-1F
 *  controller 2: channels 4-7, word operations, ports C0-DF
 *
 *  - ALL registers are 8 bits only, regardless of transfer size
 *  - channel 4 is not used - cascades 1 into 2.
 *  - channels 0-3 are byte - addresses/counts are for physical bytes
 *  - channels 5-7 are word - addresses/counts are for physical words
 *  - transfers must not cross physical 64K (0-3) or 128K (5-7) boundaries
 *  - transfer count loaded to registers is 1 less than actual count
 *  - controller 2 offsets are all even (2x offsets for controller 1)
 *  - page registers for 5-7 don&apos;t use data bit 0, represent 128K pages
 *  - page registers for 0-3 use bit 0, represent 64K pages
 *
 * DMA transfers are limited to the lower 16MB of _physical_ memory.
 * Note that addresses loaded into registers must be _physical_ addresses,
 * not logical addresses (which may differ if paging is active).
 *
 *  Address mapping for channels 0-3:
 *
 *   A23 ... A16 A15 ... A8  A7 ... A0    (Physical addresses)
 *    |  ...  |   |  ... |   |  ... |
 *    |  ...  |   |  ... |   |  ... |
 *    |  ...  |   |  ... |   |  ... |
 *   P7  ...  P0  A7 ... A0  A7 ... A0
 * |    Page    | Addr MSB | Addr LSB |   (DMA registers)
 *
 *  Address mapping for channels 5-7:
 *
 *   A23 ... A17 A16 A15 ... A9 A8 A7 ... A1 A0    (Physical addresses)
 *    |  ...  |   \   \   ... \  \  \  ... \  \
 *    |  ...  |    \   \   ... \  \  \  ... \  (not used)
 *    |  ...  |     \   \   ... \  \  \  ... \
 *   P7  ...  P1 (0) A7 A6  ... A0 A7 A6 ... A0
 * |      Page      |  Addr MSB   |  Addr LSB  |   (DMA registers)
 *
 * Again, channels 5-7 transfer _physical_ words (16 bits), so addresses
 * and counts _must_ be word-aligned (the lowest address bit is _ignored_ at
 * the hardware level, so odd-byte transfers aren&apos;t possible).
 *
 * Transfer count (_not # bytes_) is limited to 64K, represented as actual
 * count - 1 : 64K =&gt; 0xFFFF, 1 =&gt; 0x0000.  Thus, count is always 1 or more,
 * and up to 128K bytes may be transferred on channels 5-7 in one operation.
