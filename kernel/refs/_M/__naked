 * it doesn&apos;t make sense on ARM (currently the only user of __naked)
 * to trace naked functions because then mcount is called without
 * stack and frame pointer being set up and there is no chance to
 * restore the lr register to the value before mcount was called.
 *
 * The asm() bodies of naked functions often depend on standard calling
 * conventions, therefore they must be noinline and noclone.
 *
 * GCC 4.[56] currently fail to enforce this, so we must do so ourselves.
 * See GCC PR44290.
