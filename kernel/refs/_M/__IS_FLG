 * Note that nosuid etc flags are inode-specific: setting some file-system
 * flags just means all the inodes inherit those flags by default. It might be
 * possible to override it selectively if you really wanted to with some
 * ioctl() that is not currently implemented.
 *
 * Exception: SB_RDONLY is always applied to the entire file system.
 *
 * Unfortunately, it is possible to change a filesystems flags with it mounted
 * with files in use.  This means that all of the inodes will not have their
 * i_flags updated.  Hence, i_flags no longer inherit the superblock mount
 * flags, so these have to be checked separately. -- rmk@arm.uk.linux.org
