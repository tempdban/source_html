 * regmap_field_read_poll_timeout - Poll until a condition is met or timeout
 *
 * @field: Regmap field to read from
 * @val: Unsigned integer variable to read the value into
 * @cond: Break condition (usually involving @val)
 * @sleep_us: Maximum time to sleep between reads in us (0
 *            tight-loops).  Should be less than ~20ms since usleep_range
 *            is used (see Documentation/timers/timers-howto.txt).
 * @timeout_us: Timeout in us, 0 means never timeout
 *
 * Returns 0 on success and -ETIMEDOUT upon a timeout or the regmap_field_read
 * error return value in case of a error read. In the two former cases,
 * the last read value at @addr is stored in @val. Must not be called
 * from atomic context if sleep_us or timeout_us are used.
 *
 * This is modelled after the readx_poll_timeout macros in linux/iopoll.h.
