 * 16Bx2 Block Linear layout, used by desktop GPUs, and Tegra K1 and later
 *
 * Pixels are arranged in 64x8 Groups Of Bytes (GOBs). GOBs are then stacked
 * vertically by a power of 2 (1 to 32 GOBs) to form a block.
 *
 * Within a GOB, data is ordered as 16B x 2 lines sectors laid in Z-shape.
 *
 * Parameter &apos;v&apos; is the log2 encoding of the number of GOBs stacked vertically.
 * Valid values are:
 *
 * 0 == ONE_GOB
 * 1 == TWO_GOBS
 * 2 == FOUR_GOBS
 * 3 == EIGHT_GOBS
 * 4 == SIXTEEN_GOBS
 * 5 == THIRTYTWO_GOBS
 *
 * Chapter 20 &quot;Pixel Memory Formats&quot; of the Tegra X1 TRM describes this format
 * in full detail.
