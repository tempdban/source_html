 * Linear Layout

 * Just plain linear layout. Note that this is different from no specifying any
 * modifier (e.g. not setting DRM_MODE_FB_MODIFIERS in the DRM_ADDFB2 ioctl),
 * which tells the driver to also take driver-internal information into account
 * and so might actually result in a tiled framebuffer.
