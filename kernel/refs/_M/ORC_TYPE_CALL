 * ORC_TYPE_CALL: Indicates that sp_reg+sp_offset resolves to PREV_SP (the
 * caller&apos;s SP right before it made the call).  Used for all callable
 * functions, i.e. all C code and all callable asm functions.
 *
 * ORC_TYPE_REGS: Used in entry code to indicate that sp_reg+sp_offset points
 * to a fully populated pt_regs from a syscall, interrupt, or exception.
 *
 * ORC_TYPE_REGS_IRET: Used in entry code to indicate that sp_reg+sp_offset
 * points to the iret return frame.
 *
 * The UNWIND_HINT macros are used only for the unwind_hint struct.  They
 * aren&apos;t used in struct orc_entry due to size and complexity constraints.
 * Objtool converts them to real types when it converts the hints to orc
 * entries.
