 * XPM memory write test. Test XPM write logic for gross manufacturing defects
 * by writing to a dedicated test row. There are 16 locations in the test row
 * and the test can only be performed on locations that have not been
 * previously used (i.e. can be run at most 16 times). The test will pick the
 * first available location to use, or fail with ENOSPC if none left.
