 * efi_early_memdesc_ptr - get the n-th EFI memmap descriptor
 * @map: the start of efi memmap
 * @desc_size: the size of space for each EFI memmap descriptor
 * @n: the index of efi memmap descriptor
 *
 * EFI boot service provides the GetMemoryMap() function to get a copy of the
 * current memory map which is an array of memory descriptors, each of
 * which describes a contiguous block of memory. It also gets the size of the
 * map, and the size of each descriptor, etc.
 *
 * Note that per section 6.2 of UEFI Spec 2.6 Errata A, the returned size of
 * each descriptor might not be equal to sizeof(efi_memory_memdesc_t),
 * since efi_memory_memdesc_t may be extended in the future. Thus the OS
 * MUST use the returned size of the descriptor to find the start of each
 * efi_memory_memdesc_t in the memory map array. This should only be used
 * during bootup since for_each_efi_memory_desc_xxx() is available after the
 * kernel initializes the EFI subsystem to set up struct efi_memory_map.
