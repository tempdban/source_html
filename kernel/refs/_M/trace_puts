 * trace_puts - write a string into the ftrace buffer
 * @str: the string to record
 *
 * Note: __trace_bputs is an internal function for trace_puts and
 *       the @ip is passed in via the trace_puts macro.
 *
 * This is similar to trace_printk() but is made for those really fast
 * paths that a developer wants the least amount of &quot;Heisenbug&quot; effects,
 * where the processing of the print format is still too much.
 *
 * This function allows a kernel developer to debug fast path sections
 * that printk is not appropriate for. By scattering in various
 * printk like tracing in the code, a developer can quickly see
 * where problems are occurring.
 *
 * This is intended as a debugging tool for the developer only.
 * Please refrain from leaving trace_puts scattered around in
 * your code. (Extra memory is used for special buffers that are
 * allocated when trace_puts() is used.)
 *
 * Returns: 0 if nothing was written, positive # if string was.
 *  (1 when __trace_bputs is used, strlen(str) when __trace_puts is used)
