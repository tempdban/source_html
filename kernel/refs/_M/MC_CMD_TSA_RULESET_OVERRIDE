 * Override TSA ruleset that is currently active on the adapter. This operation
 * does not modify the ruleset itself. This operation provides a mechanism to
 * apply an allow-all or deny-all operation on all packets, thereby completely
 * ignoring the rule-set configured on the adapter. The main purpose of this
 * operation is to provide a deterministic state to the TSA firewall during
 * rule-set transitions.
