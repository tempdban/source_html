 * CAP_FS_MASK and CAP_NFSD_MASKS:
 *
 * The fs mask is all the privileges that fsuid==0 historically meant.
 * At one time in the past, that included CAP_MKNOD and CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE.
 *
 * It has never meant setting security.* and trusted.* xattrs.
 *
 * We could also define fsmask as follows:
 *   1. CAP_FS_MASK is the privilege to bypass all fs-related DAC permissions
 *   2. The security.* and trusted.* xattrs are fs-related MAC permissions
