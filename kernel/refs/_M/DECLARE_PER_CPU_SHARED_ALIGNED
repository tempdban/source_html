 * Declaration/definition used for per-CPU variables that must be cacheline
 * aligned under SMP conditions so that, whilst a particular instance of the
 * data corresponds to a particular CPU, inefficiencies due to direct access by
 * other CPUs are reduced by preventing the data from unnecessarily spanning
 * cachelines.
 *
 * An example of this would be statistical data, where each CPU&apos;s set of data
 * is updated by that CPU alone, but the data from across all CPUs is collated
 * by a CPU processing a read from a proc file.
