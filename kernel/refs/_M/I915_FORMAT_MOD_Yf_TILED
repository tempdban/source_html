 * Intel Yf-tiling layout
 *
 * This is a tiled layout using 4Kb tiles in row-major layout.
 * Within the tile pixels are laid out in 16 256 byte units / sub-tiles which
 * are arranged in four groups (two wide, two high) with column-major layout.
 * Each group therefore consits out of four 256 byte units, which are also laid
 * out as 2x2 column-major.
 * 256 byte units are made out of four 64 byte blocks of pixels, producing
 * either a square block or a 2:1 unit.
 * 64 byte blocks of pixels contain four pixel rows of 16 bytes, where the width
 * in pixel depends on the pixel depth.
