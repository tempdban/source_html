 * FALLOC_FL_INSERT_RANGE is use to insert space within the file size without
 * overwriting any existing data. The contents of the file beyond offset are
 * shifted towards right by len bytes to create a hole.  As such, this
 * operation will increase the size of the file by len bytes.
 *
 * Different filesystems may implement different limitations on the granularity
 * of the operation. Most will limit operations to filesystem block size
 * boundaries, but this boundary may be larger or smaller depending on
 * the filesystem and/or the configuration of the filesystem or file.
 *
 * Attempting to insert space using this flag at OR beyond the end of
 * the file is considered an illegal operation - just use ftruncate(2) or
 * fallocate(2) with mode 0 for such type of operations.
