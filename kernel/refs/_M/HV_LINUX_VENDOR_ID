 * The guest OS needs to register the guest ID with the hypervisor.
 * The guest ID is a 64 bit entity and the structure of this ID is
 * specified in the Hyper-V specification:
 *
 * msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff542653%28v=vs.85%29.aspx
 *
 * While the current guideline does not specify how Linux guest ID(s)
 * need to be generated, our plan is to publish the guidelines for
 * Linux and other guest operating systems that currently are hosted
 * on Hyper-V. The implementation here conforms to this yet
 * unpublished guidelines.
 *
 *
 * Bit(s)
 * 63 - Indicates if the OS is Open Source or not; 1 is Open Source
 * 62:56 - Os Type; Linux is 0x100
 * 55:48 - Distro specific identification
 * 47:16 - Linux kernel version number
 * 15:0  - Distro specific identification
