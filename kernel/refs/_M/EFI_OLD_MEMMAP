 * We map the EFI regions needed for runtime services non-contiguously,
 * with preserved alignment on virtual addresses starting from -4G down
 * for a total max space of 64G. This way, we provide for stable runtime
 * services addresses across kernels so that a kexec&apos;d kernel can still
 * use them.
 *
 * This is the main reason why we&apos;re doing stable VA mappings for RT
 * services.
 *
 * This flag is used in conjuction with a chicken bit called
 * &quot;efi=old_map&quot; which can be used as a fallback to the old runtime
 * services mapping method in case there&apos;s some b0rkage with a
 * particular EFI implementation (haha, it is hard to hold up the
 * sarcasm here...).
