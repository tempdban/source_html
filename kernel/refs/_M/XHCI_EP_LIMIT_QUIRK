 * Certain Intel host controllers have a limit to the number of endpoint
 * contexts they can handle.  Ideally, they would signal that they can&apos;t handle
 * anymore endpoint contexts by returning a Resource Error for the Configure
 * Endpoint command, but they don&apos;t.  Instead they expect software to keep track
 * of the number of active endpoints for them, across configure endpoint
 * commands, reset device commands, disable slot commands, and address device
 * commands.
