 * Ext[234]-style compat feature flags.
 *
 * A new feature which old metadata will still be compatible with should
 * define a DM_CACHE_FEATURE_COMPAT_* flag (rarely useful).
 *
 * A new feature that is not compatible with old code should define a
 * DM_CACHE_FEATURE_INCOMPAT_* flag and guard the relevant code with
 * that flag.
 *
 * A new feature that is not compatible with old code accessing the
 * metadata RDWR should define a DM_CACHE_FEATURE_RO_COMPAT_* flag and
 * guard the relevant code with that flag.
 *
 * As these various flags are defined they should be added to the
 * following masks.
