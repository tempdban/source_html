 * The 1/4 region under the global dirty thresh is for smooth dirty throttling:
 *
 *	(thresh - thresh/DIRTY_FULL_SCOPE, thresh)
 *
 * Further beyond, all dirtier tasks will enter a loop waiting (possibly long
 * time) for the dirty pages to drop, unless written enough pages.
 *
 * The global dirty threshold is normally equal to the global dirty limit,
 * except when the system suddenly allocates a lot of anonymous memory and
 * knocks down the global dirty threshold quickly, in which case the global
 * dirty limit will follow down slowly to prevent livelocking all dirtier tasks.
