 * list_entry_lockless - get the struct for this entry
 * @ptr:        the &amp;struct list_head pointer.
 * @type:       the type of the struct this is embedded in.
 * @member:     the name of the list_head within the struct.
 *
 * This primitive may safely run concurrently with the _rcu list-mutation
 * primitives such as list_add_rcu(), but requires some implicit RCU
 * read-side guarding.  One example is running within a special
 * exception-time environment where preemption is disabled and where
 * lockdep cannot be invoked (in which case updaters must use RCU-sched,
 * as in synchronize_sched(), call_rcu_sched(), and friends).  Another
 * example is when items are added to the list, but never deleted.
