 * Sizes of the various flavors of FADT. We need to look closely
 * at the FADT length because the version number essentially tells
 * us nothing because of many BIOS bugs where the version does not
 * match the expected length. In other words, the length of the
 * FADT is the bottom line as to what the version really is.
 *
 * For reference, the values below are as follows:
 *     FADT V1 size: 0x074
 *     FADT V2 size: 0x084
 *     FADT V3 size: 0x0F4
 *     FADT V4 size: 0x0F4
 *     FADT V5 size: 0x10C
 *     FADT V6 size: 0x114
