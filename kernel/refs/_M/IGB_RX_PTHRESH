 * PTHRESH - MAC will consider prefetch if it has fewer than this number of
 *           descriptors available in its onboard memory.
 *           Setting this to 0 disables RX descriptor prefetch.
 * HTHRESH - MAC will only prefetch if there are at least this many descriptors
 *           available in host memory.
 *           If PTHRESH is 0, this should also be 0.
 * WTHRESH - RX descriptor writeback threshold - MAC will delay writing back
 *           descriptors until either it has this many to write back, or the
 *           ITR timer expires.
