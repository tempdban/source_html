 * wait_event_cmd - sleep until a condition gets true
 * @wq_head: the waitqueue to wait on
 * @condition: a C expression for the event to wait for
 * @cmd1: the command will be executed before sleep
 * @cmd2: the command will be executed after sleep
 *
 * The process is put to sleep (TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE) until the
 * @condition evaluates to true. The @condition is checked each time
 * the waitqueue @wq_head is woken up.
 *
 * wake_up() has to be called after changing any variable that could
 * change the result of the wait condition.
