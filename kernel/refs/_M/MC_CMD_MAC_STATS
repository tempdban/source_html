 * Get generic MAC statistics. This call returns unified statistics maintained
 * by the MC as it switches between the GMAC and XMAC. The MC will write out
 * all supported stats. The driver should zero initialise the buffer to
 * guarantee consistent results. If the DMA_ADDR is 0, then no DMA is
 * performed, and the statistics may be read from the message response. If
 * DMA_ADDR != 0, then the statistics are dmad to that (page-aligned location).
 * Locks required: None. The PERIODIC_CLEAR option is not used and now has no
 * effect. Returns: 0, ETIME
