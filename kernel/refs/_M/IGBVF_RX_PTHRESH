 * PTHRESH - MAC will consider prefetch if it has fewer than this number of
 *	   descriptors available in its onboard memory.
 *	   Setting this to 0 disables RX descriptor prefetch.
 * HTHRESH - MAC will only prefetch if there are at least this many descriptors
 *	   available in host memory.
 *	   If PTHRESH is 0, this should also be 0.
 * WTHRESH - RX descriptor writeback threshold - MAC will delay writing back
 *	   descriptors until either it has this many to write back, or the
 *	   ITR timer expires.
