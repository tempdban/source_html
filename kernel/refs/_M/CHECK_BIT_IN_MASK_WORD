 * There are 32 bits/features in each mask word.  The high bits
 * (selected with (bit&gt;&gt;5) give us the word number and the low 5
 * bits give us the bit/feature number inside the word.
 * (1UL&lt;&lt;((bit)&amp;31) gives us a mask for the feature_bit so we can
 * see if it is set in the mask word.
