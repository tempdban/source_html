 * Watermark modifiers -- controls access to emergency reserves

 * __GFP_HIGH indicates that the caller is high-priority and that granting
 *   the request is necessary before the system can make forward progress.
 *   For example, creating an IO context to clean pages.
 *
 * __GFP_ATOMIC indicates that the caller cannot reclaim or sleep and is
 *   high priority. Users are typically interrupt handlers. This may be
 *   used in conjunction with __GFP_HIGH
 *
 * __GFP_MEMALLOC allows access to all memory. This should only be used when
 *   the caller guarantees the allocation will allow more memory to be freed
 *   very shortly e.g. process exiting or swapping. Users either should
 *   be the MM or co-ordinating closely with the VM (e.g. swap over NFS).
 *
 * __GFP_NOMEMALLOC is used to explicitly forbid access to emergency reserves.
 *   This takes precedence over the __GFP_MEMALLOC flag if both are set.
