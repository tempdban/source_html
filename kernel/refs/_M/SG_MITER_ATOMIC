 * Mapping sg iterator
 *
 * Iterates over sg entries mapping page-by-page.  On each successful
 * iteration, @miter-&gt;page points to the mapped page and
 * @miter-&gt;length bytes of data can be accessed at @miter-&gt;addr.  As
 * long as an interation is enclosed between start and stop, the user
 * is free to choose control structure and when to stop.
 *
 * @miter-&gt;consumed is set to @miter-&gt;length on each iteration.  It
 * can be adjusted if the user can&apos;t consume all the bytes in one go.
 * Also, a stopped iteration can be resumed by calling next on it.
 * This is useful when iteration needs to release all resources and
 * continue later (e.g. at the next interrupt).
