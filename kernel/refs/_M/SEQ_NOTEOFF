 * /dev/sequencer input events.
 *
 * The data written to the /dev/sequencer is a stream of events. Events
 * are records of 4 or 8 bytes. The first byte defines the size. 
 * Any number of events can be written with a write call. There
 * is a set of macros for sending these events. Use these macros if you
 * want to maximize portability of your program.
 *
 * Events SEQ_WAIT, SEQ_MIDIPUTC and SEQ_ECHO. Are also input events.
 * (All input events are currently 4 bytes long. Be prepared to support
 * 8 byte events also. If you receive any event having first byte &gt;= 128,
 * it&apos;s a 8 byte event.
 *
 * The events are documented at the end of this file.
 *
 * Normal events (4 bytes)
 * There is also a 8 byte version of most of the 4 byte events. The
 * 8 byte one is recommended.
