 * The owner field of the rw_semaphore structure will be set to
 * RWSEM_READER_OWNED when a reader grabs the lock. A writer will clear
 * the owner field when it unlocks. A reader, on the other hand, will
 * not touch the owner field when it unlocks.
 *
 * In essence, the owner field now has the following 4 states:
 *  1) 0
 *     - lock is free or the owner hasn&apos;t set the field yet
 *  2) RWSEM_READER_OWNED
 *     - lock is currently or previously owned by readers (lock is free
 *       or not set by owner yet)
 *  3) RWSEM_ANONYMOUSLY_OWNED bit set with some other bits set as well
 *     - lock is owned by an anonymous writer, so spinning on the lock
 *       owner should be disabled.
 *  4) Other non-zero value
 *     - a writer owns the lock and other writers can spin on the lock owner.
