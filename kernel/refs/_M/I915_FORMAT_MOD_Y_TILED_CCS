 * Intel color control surface (CCS) for render compression
 *
 * The framebuffer format must be one of the 8:8:8:8 RGB formats.
 * The main surface will be plane index 0 and must be Y/Yf-tiled,
 * the CCS will be plane index 1.
 *
 * Each CCS tile matches a 1024x512 pixel area of the main surface.
 * To match certain aspects of the 3D hardware the CCS is
 * considered to be made up of normal 128Bx32 Y tiles, Thus
 * the CCS pitch must be specified in multiples of 128 bytes.
 *
 * In reality the CCS tile appears to be a 64Bx64 Y tile, composed
 * of QWORD (8 bytes) chunks instead of OWORD (16 bytes) chunks.
 * But that fact is not relevant unless the memory is accessed
 * directly.
