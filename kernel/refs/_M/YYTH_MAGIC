 * The format used for transition tables is based on the GNU flex table
 * file format (--tables-file option; see Table File Format in the flex
 * info pages and the flex sources for documentation). The magic number
 * used in the header is 0x1B5E783D instead of 0xF13C57B1 though, because
 * new tables have been defined and others YY_ID_CHK (check) and YY_ID_DEF
 * (default) tables are used slightly differently (see the apparmor-parser
 * package).
 *
 *
 * The data in the packed dfa is stored in network byte order, and the tables
 * are arranged for flexibility.  We convert the table data to host native
 * byte order.
 *
 * The dfa begins with a table set header, and is followed by the actual
 * tables.
