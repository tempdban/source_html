 * Special handling for cmpxchg_double.  cmpxchg_double is passed two
 * percpu variables.  The first has to be aligned to a double word
 * boundary and the second has to follow directly thereafter.
 * We enforce this on all architectures even if they don&apos;t support
 * a double cmpxchg instruction, since it&apos;s a cheap requirement, and it
 * avoids breaking the requirement for architectures with the instruction.
