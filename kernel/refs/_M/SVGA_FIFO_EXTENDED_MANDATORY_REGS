 * Definition of registers included in extended FIFO support.
 *
 * The guest SVGA driver gets to allocate the FIFO between registers
 * and data.  It must always allocate at least 4 registers, but old
 * drivers stopped there.
 *
 * The VMX will enable extended FIFO support if and only if the guest
 * left enough room for all registers defined as part of the mandatory
 * set for the extended FIFO.
 *
 * Note that the guest drivers typically allocate the FIFO only at
 * initialization time, not at mode switches, so it&apos;s likely that the
 * number of FIFO registers won&apos;t change without a reboot.
 *
 * All registers less than this value are guaranteed to be present if
 * svgaUser-&gt;fifo.extended is set. Any later registers must be tested
 * individually for compatibility at each use (in the VMX).
 *
 * This value is used only by the VMX, so it can change without
 * affecting driver compatibility; keep it that way?
