 * For fixed hardware buttons, we fabricate acpi_devices with HID
 * ACPI_BUTTON_HID_POWERF or ACPI_BUTTON_HID_SLEEPF.  Fixed hardware
 * signals only an event; it doesn&apos;t supply a notification value.
 * To allow drivers to treat notifications from fixed hardware the
 * same as those from real devices, we turn the events into this
 * notification value.
