 * DOC: uevents generated by i915 on it&apos;s device node
 *
 * I915_L3_PARITY_UEVENT - Generated when the driver receives a parity mismatch
 *	event from the gpu l3 cache. Additional information supplied is ROW,
 *	BANK, SUBBANK, SLICE of the affected cacheline. Userspace should keep
 *	track of these events and if a specific cache-line seems to have a
 *	persistent error remap it with the l3 remapping tool supplied in
 *	intel-gpu-tools.  The value supplied with the event is always 1.
 *
 * I915_ERROR_UEVENT - Generated upon error detection, currently only via
 *	hangcheck. The error detection event is a good indicator of when things
 *	began to go badly. The value supplied with the event is a 1 upon error
 *	detection, and a 0 upon reset completion, signifying no more error
 *	exists. NOTE: Disabling hangcheck or reset via module parameter will
 *	cause the related events to not be seen.
 *
 * I915_RESET_UEVENT - Event is generated just before an attempt to reset the
 *	the GPU. The value supplied with the event is always 1. NOTE: Disable
 *	reset via module parameter will cause this event to not be seen.
