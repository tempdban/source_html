 * RCU_NONIDLE - Indicate idle-loop code that needs RCU readers
 * @a: Code that RCU needs to pay attention to.
 *
 * RCU, RCU-bh, and RCU-sched read-side critical sections are forbidden
 * in the inner idle loop, that is, between the rcu_idle_enter() and
 * the rcu_idle_exit() -- RCU will happily ignore any such read-side
 * critical sections.  However, things like powertop need tracepoints
 * in the inner idle loop.
 *
 * This macro provides the way out:  RCU_NONIDLE(do_something_with_RCU())
 * will tell RCU that it needs to pay attention, invoke its argument
 * (in this example, calling the do_something_with_RCU() function),
 * and then tell RCU to go back to ignoring this CPU.  It is permissible
 * to nest RCU_NONIDLE() wrappers, but not indefinitely (but the limit is
 * on the order of a million or so, even on 32-bit systems).  It is
 * not legal to block within RCU_NONIDLE(), nor is it permissible to
 * transfer control either into or out of RCU_NONIDLE()&apos;s statement.
