	 * cool &apos;this&apos; thermal zone. It shall be determined by
	 * platform characterization. This value is relative to the
	 * rest of the weights so a cooling device whose weight is
	 * double that of another cooling device is twice as
	 * effective. See Documentation/thermal/sysfs-api.txt for more
