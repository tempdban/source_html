 * struct spi_controller_mem_ops - SPI memory operations
 * @adjust_op_size: shrink the data xfer of an operation to match controller&apos;s
 *		    limitations (can be alignment of max RX/TX size
 *		    limitations)
 * @supports_op: check if an operation is supported by the controller
 * @exec_op: execute a SPI memory operation
 *
 * This interface should be implemented by SPI controllers providing an
 * high-level interface to execute SPI memory operation, which is usually the
 * case for QSPI controllers.
