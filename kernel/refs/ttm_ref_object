 * struct ttm_ref_object
 *
 * @hash: Hash entry for the per-file object reference hash.
 *
 * @head: List entry for the per-file list of ref-objects.
 *
 * @kref: Ref count.
 *
 * @obj: Base object this ref object is referencing.
 *
 * @ref_type: Type of ref object.
 *
 * This is similar to an idr object, but it also has a hash table entry
 * that allows lookup with a pointer to the referenced object as a key. In
 * that way, one can easily detect whether a base object is referenced by
 * a particular ttm_object_file. It also carries a ref count to avoid creating
 * multiple ref objects if a ttm_object_file references the same base
 * object more than once.
