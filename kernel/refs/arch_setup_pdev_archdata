 * arch_setup_pdev_archdata - Allow manipulation of archdata before its used
 * @pdev: platform device
 *
 * This is called before platform_device_add() such that any pdev_archdata may
 * be setup before the platform_notifier is called.  So if a user needs to
 * manipulate any relevant information in the pdev_archdata they can do:
 *
 *	platform_device_alloc()
 *	... manipulate ...
 *	platform_device_add()
 *
 * And if they don&apos;t care they can just call platform_device_register() and
 * everything will just work out.
