 * rcu_sync_exit() - Allow readers back onto fast patch after grace period
 * @rsp: Pointer to rcu_sync structure to use for synchronization
 *
 * This function is used by updaters who have completed, and can therefore
 * now allow readers to make use of their fastpaths after a grace period
 * has elapsed.  After this grace period has completed, all subsequent
 * calls to rcu_sync_is_idle() will return true, which tells readers that
 * they can once again use their fastpaths.
