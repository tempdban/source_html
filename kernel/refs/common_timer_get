 * Get the time remaining on a POSIX.1b interval timer.  This function
 * is ALWAYS called with spin_lock_irq on the timer, thus it must not
 * mess with irq.
 *
 * We have a couple of messes to clean up here.  First there is the case
 * of a timer that has a requeue pending.  These timers should appear to
 * be in the timer list with an expiry as if we were to requeue them
 * now.
 *
 * The second issue is the SIGEV_NONE timer which may be active but is
 * not really ever put in the timer list (to save system resources).
 * This timer may be expired, and if so, we will do it here.  Otherwise
 * it is the same as a requeue pending timer WRT to what we should
 * report.
