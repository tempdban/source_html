 * @word: the word being waited on, a kernel virtual address
 * @bit: the bit of the word being waited on
 * @mode: the task state to sleep in
 *
 * Use the standard hashed waitqueue table to wait for a bit
 * to be cleared and then to atomically set it.  This is similar
 * to wait_on_bit(), but calls io_schedule() instead of schedule()
 * for the actual waiting.
 *
 * Returns zero if the bit was (eventually) found to be clear and was
 * set.  Returns non-zero if a signal was delivered to the process and
 * the @mode allows that signal to wake the process.
