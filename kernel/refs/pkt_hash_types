 * Packet hash types specify the type of hash in skb_set_hash.
 *
 * Hash types refer to the protocol layer addresses which are used to
 * construct a packet&apos;s hash. The hashes are used to differentiate or identify
 * flows of the protocol layer for the hash type. Hash types are either
 * layer-2 (L2), layer-3 (L3), or layer-4 (L4).
 *
 * Properties of hashes:
 *
 * 1) Two packets in different flows have different hash values
 * 2) Two packets in the same flow should have the same hash value
 *
 * A hash at a higher layer is considered to be more specific. A driver should
 * set the most specific hash possible.
 *
 * A driver cannot indicate a more specific hash than the layer at which a hash
 * was computed. For instance an L3 hash cannot be set as an L4 hash.
 *
 * A driver may indicate a hash level which is less specific than the
 * actual layer the hash was computed on. For instance, a hash computed
 * at L4 may be considered an L3 hash. This should only be done if the
 * driver can&apos;t unambiguously determine that the HW computed the hash at
 * the higher layer. Note that the &quot;should&quot; in the second property above
 * permits this.
