 * struct usb_host_config - representation of a device&apos;s configuration
 * @desc: the device&apos;s configuration descriptor.
 * @string: pointer to the cached version of the iConfiguration string, if
 *	present for this configuration.
 * @intf_assoc: list of any interface association descriptors in this config
 * @interface: array of pointers to usb_interface structures, one for each
 *	interface in the configuration.  The number of interfaces is stored
 *	in desc.bNumInterfaces.  These pointers are valid only while the
 *	the configuration is active.
 * @intf_cache: array of pointers to usb_interface_cache structures, one
 *	for each interface in the configuration.  These structures exist
 *	for the entire life of the device.
 * @extra: pointer to buffer containing all extra descriptors associated
 *	with this configuration (those preceding the first interface
 *	descriptor).
 * @extralen: length of the extra descriptors buffer.
 *
 * USB devices may have multiple configurations, but only one can be active
 * at any time.  Each encapsulates a different operational environment;
 * for example, a dual-speed device would have separate configurations for
 * full-speed and high-speed operation.  The number of configurations
 * available is stored in the device descriptor as bNumConfigurations.
 *
 * A configuration can contain multiple interfaces.  Each corresponds to
 * a different function of the USB device, and all are available whenever
 * the configuration is active.  The USB standard says that interfaces
 * are supposed to be numbered from 0 to desc.bNumInterfaces-1, but a lot
 * of devices get this wrong.  In addition, the interface array is not
 * guaranteed to be sorted in numerical order.  Use usb_ifnum_to_if() to
 * look up an interface entry based on its number.
 *
 * Device drivers should not attempt to activate configurations.  The choice
 * of which configuration to install is a policy decision based on such
 * considerations as available power, functionality provided, and the user&apos;s
 * desires (expressed through userspace tools).  However, drivers can call
 * usb_reset_configuration() to reinitialize the current configuration and
 * all its interfaces.
