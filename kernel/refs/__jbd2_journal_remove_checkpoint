 * journal_remove_checkpoint: called after a buffer has been committed
 * to disk (either by being write-back flushed to disk, or being
 * committed to the log).
 *
 * We cannot safely clean a transaction out of the log until all of the
 * buffer updates committed in that transaction have safely been stored
 * elsewhere on disk.  To achieve this, all of the buffers in a
 * transaction need to be maintained on the transaction&apos;s checkpoint
 * lists until they have been rewritten, at which point this function is
 * called to remove the buffer from the existing transaction&apos;s
 * checkpoint lists.
 *
 * The function returns 1 if it frees the transaction, 0 otherwise.
 * The function can free jh and bh.
 *
 * This function is called with j_list_lock held.
