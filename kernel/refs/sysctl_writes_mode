 * enum sysctl_writes_mode - supported sysctl write modes
 *
 * @SYSCTL_WRITES_LEGACY: each write syscall must fully contain the sysctl value
 * 	to be written, and multiple writes on the same sysctl file descriptor
 * 	will rewrite the sysctl value, regardless of file position. No warning
 * 	is issued when the initial position is not 0.
 * @SYSCTL_WRITES_WARN: same as above but warn when the initial file position is
 * 	not 0.
 * @SYSCTL_WRITES_STRICT: writes to numeric sysctl entries must always be at
 * 	file position 0 and the value must be fully contained in the buffer
 * 	sent to the write syscall. If dealing with strings respect the file
 * 	position, but restrict this to the max length of the buffer, anything
 * 	passed the max lenght will be ignored. Multiple writes will append
 * 	to the buffer.
 *
 * These write modes control how current file position affects the behavior of
 * updating sysctl values through the proc interface on each write.
