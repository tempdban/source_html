   Really it is not scope, but sort of distance to the destination.
   NOWHERE are reserved for not existing destinations, HOST is our
   local addresses, LINK are destinations, located on directly attached
   link and UNIVERSE is everywhere in the Universe.

   Intermediate values are also possible f.e. interior routes
   could be assigned a value between UNIVERSE and LINK.
