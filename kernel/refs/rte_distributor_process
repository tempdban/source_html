 * Process a set of packets by distributing them among workers that request
 * packets. The distributor will ensure that no two packets that have the
 * same flow id, or tag, in the mbuf will be processed on different cores at
 * the same time.
 *
 * The user is advocated to set tag for each mbuf before calling this function.
 * If user doesn&apos;t set the tag, the tag value can be various values depending on
 * driver implementation and configuration.
 *
 * This is not multi-thread safe and should only be called on a single lcore.
 *
 * @param d
 *   The distributor instance to be used
 * @param mbufs
 *   The mbufs to be distributed
 * @param num_mbufs
 *   The number of mbufs in the mbufs array
 * @return
 *   The number of mbufs processed.
