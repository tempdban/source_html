 * An InfiniBand Subnet Administration (SA) service is a pre-defined General
 * Service Agent (GSA) provided by the Subnet Manager (SM).  On InfiniBand
 * fabrics, devices should resolve routes to other hosts by contacting the
 * SA to query the proper route.

 * Return: true if the port should act as a client to the fabric Subnet
 * Administration interface.  This does not imply that the SA service is
 * running locally.
