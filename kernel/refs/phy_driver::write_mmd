	 * Phy specific driver override for writing a MMD register.
	 * This function is optional for PHY specific drivers.  When

	 * by phy_write_mmd(), which will use either a direct write for
	 * Clause 45 PHYs, or an indirect write for Clause 22 PHYs.
	 *  devnum is the MMD device number within the PHY device,
	 *  regnum is the register within the selected MMD device.
	 *  val is the value to be written.
