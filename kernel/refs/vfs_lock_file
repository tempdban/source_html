 * vfs_lock_file - file byte range lock

 * @cmd: type of locking operation (F_SETLK, F_GETLK, etc.)
 * @fl: The lock to be applied
 * @conf: Place to return a copy of the conflicting lock, if found.
 *
 * A caller that doesn&apos;t care about the conflicting lock may pass NULL

 *
 * If the filesystem defines a private -&gt;lock() method, then @conf will
 * be left unchanged; so a caller that cares should initialize it to
 * some acceptable default.
 *
 * To avoid blocking kernel daemons, such as lockd, that need to acquire POSIX
 * locks, the -&gt;lock() interface may return asynchronously, before the lock has
 * been granted or denied by the underlying filesystem, if (and only if)
 * lm_grant is set. Callers expecting -&gt;lock() to return asynchronously
 * will only use F_SETLK, not F_SETLKW; they will set FL_SLEEP if (and only if)
 * the request is for a blocking lock. When -&gt;lock() does return asynchronously,
 * it must return FILE_LOCK_DEFERRED, and call -&gt;lm_grant() when the lock
 * request completes.
 * If the request is for non-blocking lock the file system should return
 * FILE_LOCK_DEFERRED then try to get the lock and call the callback routine
 * with the result. If the request timed out the callback routine will return a
 * nonzero return code and the file system should release the lock. The file
 * system is also responsible to keep a corresponding posix lock when it
 * grants a lock so the VFS can find out which locks are locally held and do
 * the correct lock cleanup when required.
 * The underlying filesystem must not drop the kernel lock or call
 * -&gt;lm_grant() before returning to the caller with a FILE_LOCK_DEFERRED
 * return code.
