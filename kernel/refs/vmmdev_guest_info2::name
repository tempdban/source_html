	 * The intentional meaning of this field was:
	 * Some additional information, for example &apos;Beta 1&apos; or something like
	 * that.
	 *
	 * The way it was implemented was implemented: VBG_VERSION_STRING.
	 *
	 * This means the first three members are duplicated in this field (if
	 * the guest build config is sane). So, the user must check this and
	 * chop it off before usage. There is, because of the Main code&apos;s blind
	 * trust in the field&apos;s content, no way back.
