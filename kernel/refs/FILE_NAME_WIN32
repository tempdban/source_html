<doc f='linux-4.18.y/fs/ntfs/layout.h' l='1014'>/* This is the largest namespace. It is case sensitive and allows all
	   Unicode characters except for: &apos;\0&apos; and &apos;/&apos;.  Beware that in
	   WinNT/2k/2003 by default files which eg have the same name except
	   for their case will not be distinguished by the standard utilities
	   and thus a &quot;del filename&quot; will delete both &quot;filename&quot; and &quot;fileName&quot;
	   without warning.  However if for example Services For Unix (SFU) are
	   installed and the case sensitive option was enabled at installation
	   time, then you can create/access/delete such files.
	   Note that even SFU places restrictions on the filenames beyond the
	   &apos;\0&apos; and &apos;/&apos; and in particular the following set of characters is
	   not allowed: &apos;&quot;&apos;, &apos;/&apos;, &apos;&lt;&apos;, &apos;&gt;&apos;, &apos;\&apos;.  All other characters,
	   including the ones no allowed in WIN32 namespace are allowed.
	   Tested with SFU 3.5 (this is now free) running on Windows XP. */</doc>
