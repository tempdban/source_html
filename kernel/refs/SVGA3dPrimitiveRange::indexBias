    * Optional index bias. This number is added to all indices from
    * indexArray before they are used as vertex array indices. This
    * can be used in multiple ways:
    *
    *  - When not using an indexArray, this bias can be used to
    *    specify where in the vertex arrays to begin rendering.
    *
    *  - A positive number here is equivalent to increasing the
    *    offset in each vertex array.
    *
    *  - A negative number can be used to render using a small
    *    vertex array and an index buffer that contains large
    *    values. This may be used by some applications that
    *    crop a vertex buffer without modifying their index
    *    buffer.
    *
    * Note that rendering with a negative bias value may be slower and
    * use more memory than rendering with a positive or zero bias.
