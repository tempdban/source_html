 * @warning
 * @b EXPERIMENTAL: this API may change without prior notice
 *
 * Arm a burst of event timers with same expiration timeout tick.
 *
 * Provides the same functionality as ``rte_event_timer_arm_burst()``, except
 * that application can use this API when all the event timers have the
 * same timeout expiration tick. This specialized function can provide the
 * additional hint to the adapter implementation and optimize if possible.
 *
 * @param adapter
 *   A pointer to an event timer adapter structure.
 * @param evtims
 *   Points to an array of objects of type *rte_event_timer* structure.
 * @param timeout_ticks
 *   The number of ticks in which the timers should expire.
 * @param nb_evtims
 *   Number of event timers in the supplied array.
 *
 * @return
 *   The number of successfully armed event timers. The return value can be less
 *   than the value of the *nb_evtims* parameter. If the return value is less
 *   than *nb_evtims*, the remaining event timers at the end of *evtims*
 *   are not consumed, and the caller has to take care of them, and rte_errno
 *   is set accordingly. Possible errno values include:
 *   - EINVAL Invalid timer adapter, expiry event queue ID is invalid, or an
 *   expiry event&apos;s sched type doesn&apos;t match the capabilities of the
 *   destination event queue.
 *   - EAGAIN Specified event timer adapter is not running
 *   - EALREADY A timer was encountered that was already armed
