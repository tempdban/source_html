 * Find a keyring with the specified name.
 *
 * Only keyrings that have nonzero refcount, are not revoked, and are owned by a
 * user in the current user namespace are considered.  If @uid_keyring is %true,
 * the keyring additionally must have been allocated as a user or user session
 * keyring; otherwise, it must grant Search permission directly to the caller.
 *
 * Returns a pointer to the keyring with the keyring&apos;s refcount having being
 * incremented on success.  -ENOKEY is returned if a key could not be found.
