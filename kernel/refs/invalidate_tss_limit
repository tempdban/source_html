 * If you do something evil that corrupts the cached TSS limit (I&apos;m looking
 * at you, VMX exits), call this function.
 *
 * The optimization here is that the TSS limit only matters for Linux if the
 * IO bitmap is in use.  If the TSS limit gets forced to its minimum value,
 * everything works except that IO bitmap will be ignored and all CPL 3 IO
 * instructions will #GP, which is exactly what we want for normal tasks.
