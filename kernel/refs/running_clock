 * Running clock - returns the time that has elapsed while a guest has been
 * running.
 * On a guest this value should be local_clock minus the time the guest was
 * suspended by the hypervisor (for any reason).
 * On bare metal this function should return the same as local_clock.
 * Architectures and sub-architectures can override this.
