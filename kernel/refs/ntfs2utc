 * ntfs2utc - convert NTFS time to Linux time
 * @time:	NTFS time (little endian) to convert to Linux UTC
 *
 * Convert the little endian NTFS time @time to its corresponding Linux UTC
 * time and return that in cpu format.
 *
 * Linux stores time in a struct timespec consisting of a time_t (long at
 * present) tv_sec and a long tv_nsec where tv_sec is the number of 1-second
 * intervals since 1st January 1970, 00:00:00 UTC and tv_nsec is the number of
 * 1-nano-second intervals since the value of tv_sec.
 *
 * NTFS uses Microsoft&apos;s standard time format which is stored in a s64 and is
 * measured as the number of 100 nano-second intervals since 1st January 1601,
 * 00:00:00 UTC.
