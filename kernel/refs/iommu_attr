 * Following constraints are specifc to FSL_PAMUV1:
 *  -aperture must be power of 2, and naturally aligned
 *  -number of windows must be power of 2, and address space size
 *   of each window is determined by aperture size / # of windows
 *  -the actual size of the mapped region of a window must be power
 *   of 2 starting with 4KB and physical address must be naturally
 *   aligned.
 * DOMAIN_ATTR_FSL_PAMUV1 corresponds to the above mentioned contraints.
 * The caller can invoke iommu_domain_get_attr to check if the underlying
 * iommu implementation supports these constraints.
