<doc f='linux-4.18.y/include/linux/bpf.h' l='338'>/* an array of programs to be executed under rcu_lock.
 *
 * Typical usage:
 * ret = BPF_PROG_RUN_ARRAY(&amp;bpf_prog_array, ctx, BPF_PROG_RUN);
 *
 * the structure returned by bpf_prog_array_alloc() should be populated
 * with program pointers and the last pointer must be NULL.
 * The user has to keep refcnt on the program and make sure the program
 * is removed from the array before bpf_prog_put().
 * The &apos;struct bpf_prog_array *&apos; should only be replaced with xchg()
 * since other cpus are walking the array of pointers in parallel.
