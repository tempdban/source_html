 * enum xz_mode - Operation mode
 *
 * @XZ_SINGLE:              Single-call mode. This uses less RAM than
 *                          than multi-call modes, because the LZMA2
 *                          dictionary doesn&apos;t need to be allocated as
 *                          part of the decoder state. All required data
 *                          structures are allocated at initialization,
 *                          so xz_dec_run() cannot return XZ_MEM_ERROR.
 * @XZ_PREALLOC:            Multi-call mode with preallocated LZMA2
 *                          dictionary buffer. All data structures are
 *                          allocated at initialization, so xz_dec_run()
 *                          cannot return XZ_MEM_ERROR.
 * @XZ_DYNALLOC:            Multi-call mode. The LZMA2 dictionary is
 *                          allocated once the required size has been
 *                          parsed from the stream headers. If the
 *                          allocation fails, xz_dec_run() will return
 *                          XZ_MEM_ERROR.
 *
 * It is possible to enable support only for a subset of the above
 * modes at compile time by defining XZ_DEC_SINGLE, XZ_DEC_PREALLOC,
 * or XZ_DEC_DYNALLOC. The xz_dec kernel module is always compiled
 * with support for all operation modes, but the preboot code may
 * be built with fewer features to minimize code size.
