 * Function:    scsi_report_device_reset()
 *
 * Purpose:     Utility function used by low-level drivers to report that
 *		they have observed a device reset on the device being handled.
 *
 * Arguments:   shost       - Host in question
 *		channel     - channel on which reset was observed
 *		target	    - target on which reset was observed
 *
 * Returns:     Nothing
 *
 * Lock status: Host lock must be held
 *
 * Notes:       This only needs to be called if the reset is one which
 *		originates from an unknown location.  Resets originated
 *		by the mid-level itself don&apos;t need to call this, but there
 *		should be no harm.
 *
 *		The main purpose of this is to make sure that a CHECK_CONDITION
 *		is properly treated.
