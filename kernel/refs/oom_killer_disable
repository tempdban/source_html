 * oom_killer_disable - disable OOM killer
 * @timeout: maximum timeout to wait for oom victims in jiffies
 *
 * Forces all page allocations to fail rather than trigger OOM killer.
 * Will block and wait until all OOM victims are killed or the given
 * timeout expires.
 *
 * The function cannot be called when there are runnable user tasks because
 * the userspace would see unexpected allocation failures as a result. Any
 * new usage of this function should be consulted with MM people.
 *
 * Returns true if successful and false if the OOM killer cannot be
 * disabled.
