	 * Per-cpu workqueues are generally preferred because they tend to
	 * show better performance thanks to cache locality.  Per-cpu
	 * workqueues exclude the scheduler from choosing the CPU to
	 * execute the worker threads, which has an unfortunate side effect
	 * of increasing power consumption.
	 *
	 * The scheduler considers a CPU idle if it doesn&apos;t have any task
	 * to execute and tries to keep idle cores idle to conserve power;
	 * however, for example, a per-cpu work item scheduled from an
	 * interrupt handler on an idle CPU will force the scheduler to
	 * excute the work item on that CPU breaking the idleness, which in
	 * turn may lead to more scheduling choices which are sub-optimal
	 * in terms of power consumption.
	 *
	 * Workqueues marked with WQ_POWER_EFFICIENT are per-cpu by default
	 * but become unbound if workqueue.power_efficient kernel param is
	 * specified.  Per-cpu workqueues which are identified to
	 * contribute significantly to power-consumption are identified and
	 * marked with this flag and enabling the power_efficient mode
	 * leads to noticeable power saving at the cost of small
	 * performance disadvantage.
