 * struct clk_hw - handle for traversing from a struct clk to its corresponding
 * hardware-specific structure.  struct clk_hw should be declared within struct
 * clk_foo and then referenced by the struct clk instance that uses struct
 * clk_foo&apos;s clk_ops
 *
 * @core: pointer to the struct clk_core instance that points back to this
 * struct clk_hw instance
 *
 * @clk: pointer to the per-user struct clk instance that can be used to call
 * into the clk API
 *
 * @init: pointer to struct clk_init_data that contains the init data shared
 * with the common clock framework.
