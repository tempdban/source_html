 * In this case, we assume the host controller is broken or dying or dead.  The
 * host may still be completing some other events, so we have to be careful to
 * let the event ring handler and the URB dequeueing/enqueueing functions know
 * through xhci-&gt;state.
 *
 * The timer may also fire if the host takes a very long time to respond to the
 * command, and the stop endpoint command completion handler cannot delete the
 * timer before the timer function is called.  Another endpoint cancellation may
 * sneak in before the timer function can grab the lock, and that may queue
 * another stop endpoint command and add the timer back.  So we cannot use a
 * simple flag to say whether there is a pending stop endpoint command for a
 * particular endpoint.
 *
 * Instead we use a combination of that flag and checking if a new timer is
 * pending.
