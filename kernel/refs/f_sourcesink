 * SOURCE/SINK FUNCTION ... a primary testing vehicle for USB peripheral
 * controller drivers.
 *
 * This just sinks bulk packets OUT to the peripheral and sources them IN
 * to the host, optionally with specific data patterns for integrity tests.
 * As such it supports basic functionality and load tests.
 *
 * In terms of control messaging, this supports all the standard requests
 * plus two that support control-OUT tests.  If the optional &quot;autoresume&quot;
 * mode is enabled, it provides good functional coverage for the &quot;USBCV&quot;
 * test harness from USB-IF.
