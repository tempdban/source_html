	 * This callback is used to update the display mode of an encoder.
	 *
	 * Note that the display pipe is completely off when this function is
	 * called. Drivers which need hardware to be running before they program
	 * the new display mode (because they implement runtime PM) should not
	 * use this hook, because the helper library calls it only once and not
	 * every time the display pipeline is suspended using either DPMS or the
	 * new &quot;ACTIVE&quot; property. Such drivers should instead move all their
	 * encoder setup into the @enable callback.
	 *
	 * This callback is used by the atomic modeset helpers in place of the
	 * @mode_set callback, if set by the driver. It is optional and should
	 * be used instead of @mode_set if the driver needs to inspect the
	 * connector state or display info, since there is no direct way to
	 * go from the encoder to the current connector.
