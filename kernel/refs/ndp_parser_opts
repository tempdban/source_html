 * Here are options for NCM Datagram Pointer table (NDP) parser.
 * There are 2 different formats: NDP16 and NDP32 in the spec (ch. 3),
 * in NDP16 offsets and sizes fields are 1 16bit word wide,
 * in NDP32 -- 2 16bit words wide. Also signatures are different.
 * To make the parser code the same, put the differences in the structure,
 * and switch pointers to the structures when the format is changed.
