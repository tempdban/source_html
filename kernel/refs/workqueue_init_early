 * workqueue_init_early - early init for workqueue subsystem
 *
 * This is the first half of two-staged workqueue subsystem initialization
 * and invoked as soon as the bare basics - memory allocation, cpumasks and
 * idr are up.  It sets up all the data structures and system workqueues
 * and allows early boot code to create workqueues and queue/cancel work
 * items.  Actual work item execution starts only after kthreads can be
 * created and scheduled right before early initcalls.
