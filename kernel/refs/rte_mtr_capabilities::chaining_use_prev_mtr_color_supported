	 * When non-zero, it indicates that the packet color identified by one
	 * MTR object can be used as the packet input color by any subsequent
	 * MTR object from the same flow. When zero, it indicates that the color
	 * determined by one MTR object is always ignored by any subsequent MTR
	 * object from the same flow. Only valid when MTR chaining is supported,
	 * i.e. *chaining_n_mtrs_per_flow_max* is greater than 1. When non-zero,
	 * it also means that the color aware mode is supported by at least one
	 * metering algorithm.
