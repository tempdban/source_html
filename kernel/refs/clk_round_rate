 * clk_round_rate - adjust a rate to the exact rate a clock can provide
 * @clk: clock source
 * @rate: desired clock rate in Hz
 *
 * This answers the question &quot;if I were to pass @rate to clk_set_rate(),
 * what clock rate would I end up with?&quot; without changing the hardware
 * in any way.  In other words:
 *
 *   rate = clk_round_rate(clk, r);
 *
 * and:
 *
 *   clk_set_rate(clk, r);
 *   rate = clk_get_rate(clk);
 *
 * are equivalent except the former does not modify the clock hardware
 * in any way.
 *
 * Returns rounded clock rate in Hz, or negative errno.
