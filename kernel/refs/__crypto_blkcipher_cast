 * DOC: Synchronous Block Cipher API
 *
 * The synchronous block cipher API is used with the ciphers of type
 * CRYPTO_ALG_TYPE_BLKCIPHER (listed as type &quot;blkcipher&quot; in /proc/crypto)
 *
 * Synchronous calls, have a context in the tfm. But since a single tfm can be
 * used in multiple calls and in parallel, this info should not be changeable
 * (unless a lock is used). This applies, for example, to the symmetric key.
 * However, the IV is changeable, so there is an iv field in blkcipher_tfm
 * structure for synchronous blkcipher api. So, its the only state info that can
 * be kept for synchronous calls without using a big lock across a tfm.
 *
 * The block cipher API allows the use of a complete cipher, i.e. a cipher
 * consisting of a template (a block chaining mode) and a single block cipher
 * primitive (e.g. AES).
 *
 * The plaintext data buffer and the ciphertext data buffer are pointed to
 * by using scatter/gather lists. The cipher operation is performed
 * on all segments of the provided scatter/gather lists.
 *
 * The kernel crypto API supports a cipher operation &quot;in-place&quot; which means that
 * the caller may provide the same scatter/gather list for the plaintext and
 * cipher text. After the completion of the cipher operation, the plaintext
 * data is replaced with the ciphertext data in case of an encryption and vice
 * versa for a decryption. The caller must ensure that the scatter/gather lists
 * for the output data point to sufficiently large buffers, i.e. multiples of
 * the block size of the cipher.
