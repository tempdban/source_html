	 *
	 * R1) One and only one ASCONF Chunk MAY be in transit and
	 * unacknowledged at any one time.  If a sender, after sending
	 * an ASCONF chunk, decides it needs to transfer another
	 * ASCONF Chunk, it MUST wait until the ASCONF-ACK Chunk
	 * returns from the previous ASCONF Chunk before sending a
	 * subsequent ASCONF. Note this restriction binds each side,
	 * so at any time two ASCONF may be in-transit on any given
	 * association (one sent from each endpoint).
	 *
	 * [This is our one-and-only-one ASCONF in flight.  If we do
	 * not have an ASCONF in flight, this is NULL.]
