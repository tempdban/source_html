 * tracehook_report_syscall_entry - task is about to attempt a system call
 * @regs:		user register state of current task
 *
 * This will be called if %TIF_SYSCALL_TRACE has been set, when the
 * current task has just entered the kernel for a system call.
 * Full user register state is available here.  Changing the values
 * in @regs can affect the system call number and arguments to be tried.
 * It is safe to block here, preventing the system call from beginning.
 *
 * Returns zero normally, or nonzero if the calling arch code should abort
 * the system call.  That must prevent normal entry so no system call is
 * made.  If @task ever returns to user mode after this, its register state
 * is unspecified, but should be something harmless like an %ENOSYS error
 * return.  It should preserve enough information so that syscall_rollback()
 * can work (see asm-generic/syscall.h).
 *
 * Called without locks, just after entering kernel mode.
