	 * recent_used_cpu is initially set as the last CPU used by a task
	 * that wakes affine another task. Waker/wakee relationships can
	 * push tasks around a CPU where each wakeup moves to the next one.
	 * Tracking a recently used CPU allows a quick search for a recently
	 * used CPU that may be idle.
