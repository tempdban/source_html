	 * Some bool flags:
	 *
	 * @dl_throttled tells if we exhausted the runtime. If so, the
	 * task has to wait for a replenishment to be performed at the
	 * next firing of dl_timer.
	 *
	 * @dl_boosted tells if we are boosted due to DI. If so we are
	 * outside bandwidth enforcement mechanism (but only until we
	 * exit the critical section);
	 *
	 * @dl_yielded tells if task gave up the CPU before consuming
	 * all its available runtime during the last job.
	 *
	 * @dl_non_contending tells if the task is inactive while still
	 * contributing to the active utilization. In other words, it
	 * indicates if the inactive timer has been armed and its handler
	 * has not been executed yet. This flag is useful to avoid race
	 * conditions between the inactive timer handler and the wakeup
	 * code.
	 *
	 * @dl_overrun tells if the task asked to be informed about runtime
	 * overruns.
