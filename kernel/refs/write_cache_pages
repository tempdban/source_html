 * write_cache_pages - walk the list of dirty pages of the given address space and write all of them.
 * @mapping: address space structure to write
 * @wbc: subtract the number of written pages from *@wbc-&gt;nr_to_write
 * @writepage: function called for each page
 * @data: data passed to writepage function
 *
 * If a page is already under I/O, write_cache_pages() skips it, even
 * if it&apos;s dirty.  This is desirable behaviour for memory-cleaning writeback,
 * but it is INCORRECT for data-integrity system calls such as fsync().  fsync()
 * and msync() need to guarantee that all the data which was dirty at the time
 * the call was made get new I/O started against them.  If wbc-&gt;sync_mode is
 * WB_SYNC_ALL then we were called for data integrity and we must wait for
 * existing IO to complete.
 *
 * To avoid livelocks (when other process dirties new pages), we first tag
 * pages which should be written back with TOWRITE tag and only then start
 * writing them. For data-integrity sync we have to be careful so that we do
 * not miss some pages (e.g., because some other process has cleared TOWRITE
 * tag we set). The rule we follow is that TOWRITE tag can be cleared only
 * by the process clearing the DIRTY tag (and submitting the page for IO).
