 * __copy_to_user_inatomic: - Copy a block of data into user space, with less checking.
 * @to:   Destination address, in user space.
 * @from: Source address, in kernel space.
 * @n:    Number of bytes to copy.
 *
 * Context: User context only.
 *
 * Copy data from kernel space to user space.  Caller must check
 * the specified block with access_ok() before calling this function.
 * The caller should also make sure he pins the user space address
 * so that we don&apos;t result in page fault and sleep.
