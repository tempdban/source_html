 * synchronize_rcu_bh_expedited - Brute-force RCU-bh grace period
 *
 * Wait for an RCU-bh grace period to elapse, but use a &quot;big hammer&quot;
 * approach to force the grace period to end quickly.  This consumes
 * significant time on all CPUs and is unfriendly to real-time workloads,
 * so is thus not recommended for any sort of common-case code.  In fact,
 * if you are using synchronize_rcu_bh_expedited() in a loop, please
 * restructure your code to batch your updates, and then use a single
 * synchronize_rcu_bh() instead.
 *
 * Note that it is illegal to call this function while holding any lock
 * that is acquired by a CPU-hotplug notifier.  And yes, it is also illegal
 * to call this function from a CPU-hotplug notifier.  Failing to observe
 * these restriction will result in deadlock.
