 * set_dma_reserve - set the specified number of pages reserved in the first zone
 * @new_dma_reserve: The number of pages to mark reserved
 *
 * The per-cpu batchsize and zone watermarks are determined by managed_pages.
 * In the DMA zone, a significant percentage may be consumed by kernel image
 * and other unfreeable allocations which can skew the watermarks badly. This
 * function may optionally be used to account for unfreeable pages in the
 * first zone (e.g., ZONE_DMA). The effect will be lower watermarks and
 * smaller per-cpu batchsize.
