 * struct dmx_buffer - dmx buffer info
 *
 * @index:	id number of the buffer
 * @bytesused:	number of bytes occupied by data in the buffer (payload);
 * @offset:	for buffers with memory == DMX_MEMORY_MMAP;
 *		offset from the start of the device memory for this plane,
 *		(or a &quot;cookie&quot; that should be passed to mmap() as offset)
 * @length:	size in bytes of the buffer
 * @flags:	bit array of buffer flags as defined by &amp;enum dmx_buffer_flags.
 *		Filled only at &amp;DMX_DQBUF.
 * @count:	monotonic counter for filled buffers. Helps to identify
 *		data stream loses. Filled only at &amp;DMX_DQBUF.
 *
 * Contains data exchanged by application and driver using one of the streaming
 * I/O methods.
 *
 * Please notice that, for &amp;DMX_QBUF, only @index should be filled.
 * On &amp;DMX_DQBUF calls, all fields will be filled by the Kernel.
