 * ntfs_index_entry_mark_dirty - mark an index entry dirty
 * @ictx:	ntfs index context describing the index entry
 *
 * Mark the index entry described by the index entry context @ictx dirty.
 *
 * If the index entry is in the index root attribute, simply mark the mft
 * record containing the index root attribute dirty.  This ensures the mft
 * record, and hence the index root attribute, will be written out to disk
 * later.
 *
 * If the index entry is in an index block belonging to the index allocation
 * attribute, mark the buffers belonging to the index record as well as the
 * page cache page the index block is in dirty.  This automatically marks the
 * VFS inode of the ntfs index inode to which the index entry belongs dirty,
 * too (I_DIRTY_PAGES) and this in turn ensures the page buffers, and hence the
 * dirty index block, will be written out to disk later.
