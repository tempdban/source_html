 * i2c_new_secondary_device - Helper to get the instantiated secondary address
 * and create the associated device
 * @client: Handle to the primary client
 * @name: Handle to specify which secondary address to get
 * @default_addr: Used as a fallback if no secondary address was specified
 * Context: can sleep
 *
 * I2C clients can be composed of multiple I2C slaves bound together in a single
 * component. The I2C client driver then binds to the master I2C slave and needs
 * to create I2C dummy clients to communicate with all the other slaves.
 *
 * This function creates and returns an I2C dummy client whose I2C address is
 * retrieved from the platform firmware based on the given slave name. If no
 * address is specified by the firmware default_addr is used.
 *
 * On DT-based platforms the address is retrieved from the &quot;reg&quot; property entry
 * cell whose &quot;reg-names&quot; value matches the slave name.
 *
 * This returns the new i2c client, which should be saved for later use with
 * i2c_unregister_device(); or NULL to indicate an error.
