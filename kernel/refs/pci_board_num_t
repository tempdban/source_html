 * This is the configuration table for all of the PCI serial boards
 * which we support.  It is directly indexed by the pci_board_num_t enum
 * value, which is encoded in the pci_device_id PCI probe table&apos;s
 * driver_data member.
 *
 * The makeup of these names are:
 *  pbn_bn{_bt}_n_baud{_offsetinhex}
 *
 *  bn		= PCI BAR number
 *  bt		= Index using PCI BARs
 *  n		= number of serial ports
 *  baud	= baud rate
 *  offsetinhex	= offset for each sequential port (in hex)
 *
 * This table is sorted by (in order): bn, bt, baud, offsetindex, n.
 *
 * Please note: in theory if n = 1, _bt infix should make no difference.
 * ie, pbn_b0_1_115200 is the same as pbn_b0_bt_1_115200
