 * cpuset_memory_pressure_bump - keep stats of per-cpuset reclaims.
 *
 * Keep a running average of the rate of synchronous (direct)
 * page reclaim efforts initiated by tasks in each cpuset.
 *
 * This represents the rate at which some task in the cpuset
 * ran low on memory on all nodes it was allowed to use, and
 * had to enter the kernels page reclaim code in an effort to
 * create more free memory by tossing clean pages or swapping
 * or writing dirty pages.
 *
 * Display to user space in the per-cpuset read-only file
 * &quot;memory_pressure&quot;.  Value displayed is an integer
 * representing the recent rate of entry into the synchronous
 * (direct) page reclaim by any task attached to the cpuset.
