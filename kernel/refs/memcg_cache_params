 * This is the main placeholder for memcg-related information in kmem caches.
 * Both the root cache and the child caches will have it. For the root cache,
 * this will hold a dynamically allocated array large enough to hold
 * information about the currently limited memcgs in the system. To allow the
 * array to be accessed without taking any locks, on relocation we free the old
 * version only after a grace period.
 *
 * Root and child caches hold different metadata.
 *
 * @root_cache:	Common to root and child caches.  NULL for root, pointer to
 *		the root cache for children.
 *
 * The following fields are specific to root caches.
 *
 * @memcg_caches: kmemcg ID indexed table of child caches.  This table is
 *		used to index child cachces during allocation and cleared
 *		early during shutdown.
 *
 * @root_caches_node: List node for slab_root_caches list.
 *
 * @children:	List of all child caches.  While the child caches are also
 *		reachable through @memcg_caches, a child cache remains on
 *		this list until it is actually destroyed.
 *
 * The following fields are specific to child caches.
 *
 * @memcg:	Pointer to the memcg this cache belongs to.
 *
 * @children_node: List node for @root_cache-&gt;children list.
 *
 * @kmem_caches_node: List node for @memcg-&gt;kmem_caches list.
