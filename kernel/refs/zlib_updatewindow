   Update the window with the last wsize (normally 32K) bytes written before

   stream has not been reached yet. It is also called to window dictionary data
   when a dictionary is loaded.

   Providing output buffers larger than 32K to inflate() should provide a speed
   advantage, since only the last 32K of output is copied to the sliding window
   upon return from inflate(), and since all distances after the first 32K of
   output will fall in the output data, making match copies simpler and faster.
   The advantage may be dependent on the size of the processor&apos;s data caches.
