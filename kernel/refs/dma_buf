 * struct dma_buf - shared buffer object
 * @size: size of the buffer
 * @file: file pointer used for sharing buffers across, and for refcounting.
 * @attachments: list of dma_buf_attachment that denotes all devices attached.
 * @ops: dma_buf_ops associated with this buffer object.
 * @lock: used internally to serialize list manipulation, attach/detach and vmap/unmap
 * @vmapping_counter: used internally to refcnt the vmaps
 * @vmap_ptr: the current vmap ptr if vmapping_counter &gt; 0
 * @exp_name: name of the exporter; useful for debugging.
 * @owner: pointer to exporter module; used for refcounting when exporter is a
 *         kernel module.
 * @list_node: node for dma_buf accounting and debugging.
 * @priv: exporter specific private data for this buffer object.
 * @resv: reservation object linked to this dma-buf
 * @poll: for userspace poll support
 * @cb_excl: for userspace poll support
 * @cb_shared: for userspace poll support
 *
 * This represents a shared buffer, created by calling dma_buf_export(). The
 * userspace representation is a normal file descriptor, which can be created by
 * calling dma_buf_fd().
 *
 * Shared dma buffers are reference counted using dma_buf_put() and
 * get_dma_buf().
 *
 * Device DMA access is handled by the separate &amp;struct dma_buf_attachment.
