 * This is the (kernel) stack-layout when we have done a &quot;SAVE_ALL&quot; from vm86
 * mode - the main change is that the old segment descriptors aren&apos;t
 * useful any more and are forced to be zero by the kernel (and the
 * hardware when a trap occurs), and the real segment descriptors are
 * at the end of the structure. Look at ptrace.h to see the &quot;normal&quot;
 * setup. For user space layout see &apos;struct vm86_regs&apos; above.
