 * blk_queue_make_request - define an alternate make_request function for a device
 * @q:  the request queue for the device to be affected
 * @mfn: the alternate make_request function
 *
 * Description:
 *    The normal way for &amp;struct bios to be passed to a device
 *    driver is for them to be collected into requests on a request
 *    queue, and then to allow the device driver to select requests
 *    off that queue when it is ready.  This works well for many block
 *    devices. However some block devices (typically virtual devices
 *    such as md or lvm) do not benefit from the processing on the
 *    request queue, and are served best by having the requests passed
 *    directly to them.  This can be achieved by providing a function
 *    to blk_queue_make_request().
 *
 * Caveat:
 *    The driver that does this *must* be able to deal appropriately
 *    with buffers in &quot;highmemory&quot;. This can be accomplished by either calling
 *    kmap_atomic() to get a temporary kernel mapping, or by calling
 *    blk_queue_bounce() to create a buffer in normal memory.
