 * usb_new_device - perform initial device setup (usbcore-internal)
 * @udev: newly addressed device (in ADDRESS state)
 *
 * This is called with devices which have been detected but not fully
 * enumerated.  The device descriptor is available, but not descriptors
 * for any device configuration.  The caller must have locked either
 * the parent hub (if udev is a normal device) or else the
 * usb_bus_idr_lock (if udev is a root hub).  The parent&apos;s pointer to
 * udev has already been installed, but udev is not yet visible through
 * sysfs or other filesystem code.
 *
 * This call is synchronous, and may not be used in an interrupt context.
 *
 * Only the hub driver or root-hub registrar should ever call this.
 *
 * Return: Whether the device is configured properly or not. Zero if the
 * interface was registered with the driver core; else a negative errno
 * value.
