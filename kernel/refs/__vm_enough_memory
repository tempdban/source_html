 * Check that a process has enough memory to allocate a new virtual
 * mapping. 0 means there is enough memory for the allocation to
 * succeed and -ENOMEM implies there is not.
 *
 * We currently support three overcommit policies, which are set via the
 * vm.overcommit_memory sysctl.  See Documentation/vm/overcommit-accounting.rst
 *
 * Strict overcommit modes added 2002 Feb 26 by Alan Cox.
 * Additional code 2002 Jul 20 by Robert Love.
 *
 * cap_sys_admin is 1 if the process has admin privileges, 0 otherwise.
 *
 * Note this is a helper function intended to be used by LSMs which
 * wish to use this logic.
