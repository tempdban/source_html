 * We don&apos;t want these functions to fail if CONFIG_HWSPINLOCK is not
 * enabled. We prefer to silently succeed in this case, and let the
 * code path get compiled away. This way, if CONFIG_HWSPINLOCK is not
 * required on a given setup, users will still work.
 *
 * The only exception is hwspin_lock_register/hwspin_lock_unregister, with which
 * we _do_ want users to fail (no point in registering hwspinlock instances if
 * the framework is not available).
 *
 * Note: ERR_PTR(-ENODEV) will still be considered a success for NULL-checking
 * users. Others, which care, can still check this with IS_ERR.
