 *	radix_tree_gang_lookup - perform multiple lookup on a radix tree
 *	@root:		radix tree root
 *	@results:	where the results of the lookup are placed
 *	@first_index:	start the lookup from this key
 *	@max_items:	place up to this many items at *results
 *
 *	Performs an index-ascending scan of the tree for present items.  Places
 *	them at *@results and returns the number of items which were placed at
 *	*@results.
 *
 *	The implementation is naive.
 *
 *	Like radix_tree_lookup, radix_tree_gang_lookup may be called under
 *	rcu_read_lock. In this case, rather than the returned results being
 *	an atomic snapshot of the tree at a single point in time, the
 *	semantics of an RCU protected gang lookup are as though multiple
 *	radix_tree_lookups have been issued in individual locks, and results
 *	stored in &apos;results&apos;.
