 * struct acomp_alg - asynchronous compression algorithm
 *
 * @compress:	Function performs a compress operation
 * @decompress:	Function performs a de-compress operation
 * @dst_free:	Frees destination buffer if allocated inside the algorithm
 * @init:	Initialize the cryptographic transformation object.
 *		This function is used to initialize the cryptographic
 *		transformation object. This function is called only once at
 *		the instantiation time, right after the transformation context
 *		was allocated. In case the cryptographic hardware has some
 *		special requirements which need to be handled by software, this
 *		function shall check for the precise requirement of the
 *		transformation and put any software fallbacks in place.
 * @exit:	Deinitialize the cryptographic transformation object. This is a
 *		counterpart to @init, used to remove various changes set in
 *		@init.
 *
 * @reqsize:	Context size for (de)compression requests
 * @base:	Common crypto API algorithm data structure
