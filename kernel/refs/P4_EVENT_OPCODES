 *
 * MSR_P4_IQ_ESCR0 and MSR_P4_IQ_ESCR1 are available only on early
 * processor builds (family 0FH, models 01H-02H). These MSRs
 * are not available on later versions, so that we don&apos;t use
 * them completely
 *
 * Also note that CCCR1 do not have P4_CCCR_ENABLE bit properly
 * working so that we should not use this CCCR and respective
 * counter as result
