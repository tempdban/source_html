 * enum vga_switcheroo_handler_flags_t - handler flags bitmask
 * @VGA_SWITCHEROO_CAN_SWITCH_DDC: whether the handler is able to switch the
 * 	DDC lines separately. This signals to clients that they should call
 * 	drm_get_edid_switcheroo() to probe the EDID
 * @VGA_SWITCHEROO_NEEDS_EDP_CONFIG: whether the handler is unable to switch
 * 	the AUX channel separately. This signals to clients that the active
 * 	GPU needs to train the link and communicate the link parameters to the
 * 	inactive GPU (mediated by vga_switcheroo). The inactive GPU may then
 * 	skip the AUX handshake and set up its output with these pre-calibrated
 * 	values (DisplayPort specification v1.1a, section 2.5.3.3)
 *
 * Handler flags bitmask. Used by handlers to declare their capabilities upon
 * registering with vga_switcheroo.
