 * NOTE: Two special error codes you should check for when calling
 * in to the driver are:
 *
 * EINTR -- The operation has been interupted.  This should be
 * handled by retrying the ioctl() until a different error code
 * is returned.
 *
 * ECONNREFUSED -- The driver is no longer accepting operations
 * from your process.  That is, the process is being destroyed.
 * You should handle this by exiting from your process.  Note
 * that once this error code is returned, all further calls to
 * the driver from any thread will return this same code.
