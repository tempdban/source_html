 * struct rng_alg - random number generator definition
 *
 * @generate:	The function defined by this variable obtains a
 *		random number. The random number generator transform
 *		must generate the random number out of the context
 *		provided with this call, plus any additional data
 *		if provided to the call.
 * @seed:	Seed or reseed the random number generator.  With the
 *		invocation of this function call, the random number
 *		generator shall become ready for generation.  If the
 *		random number generator requires a seed for setting
 *		up a new state, the seed must be provided by the
 *		consumer while invoking this function. The required
 *		size of the seed is defined with @seedsize .
 * @set_ent:	Set entropy that would otherwise be obtained from
 *		entropy source.  Internal use only.
 * @seedsize:	The seed size required for a random number generator
 *		initialization defined with this variable. Some
 *		random number generators does not require a seed
 *		as the seeding is implemented internally without
 *		the need of support by the consumer. In this case,
 *		the seed size is set to zero.
 * @base:	Common crypto API algorithm data structure.
