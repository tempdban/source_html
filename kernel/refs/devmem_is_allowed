 * devmem_is_allowed() checks to see if /dev/mem access to a certain address
 * is valid. The argument is a physical page number.
 *
 * On x86, access has to be given to the first megabyte of RAM because that
 * area traditionally contains BIOS code and data regions used by X, dosemu,
 * and similar apps. Since they map the entire memory range, the whole range
 * must be allowed (for mapping), but any areas that would otherwise be
 * disallowed are flagged as being &quot;zero filled&quot; instead of rejected.
 * Access has to be given to non-kernel-ram areas as well, these contain the
 * PCI mmio resources as well as potential bios/acpi data regions.
