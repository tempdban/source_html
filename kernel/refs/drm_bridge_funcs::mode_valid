	 * restriction in the modes it can display. For example, a given bridge
	 * may be responsible to set a clock value. If the clock can not

	 * can be used to restrict the number of modes to only the ones that

	 * drm_helper_probe_single_connector_modes(), and it is used by the

	 * drm_atomic_helper_check_modeset().
	 *
	 * This function is optional.

	 * NOTE:
	 *
	 * Since this function is both called from the check phase of an atomic
	 * commit, and the mode validation in the probe paths it is not allowed
	 * to look at anything else but the passed-in mode, and validate it

	 * limits which depend upon the configuration can only be checked in
	 * @mode_fixup.
