 * Intel&apos;s Panther Point chipset has two host controllers (EHCI and xHCI) that
 * share some number of ports.  These ports can be switched between either
 * controller.  Not all of the ports under the EHCI host controller may be
 * switchable.
 *
 * The ports should be switched over to xHCI before PCI probes for any device
 * start.  This avoids active devices under EHCI being disconnected during the
 * port switchover, which could cause loss of data on USB storage devices, or
 * failed boot when the root file system is on a USB mass storage device and is
 * enumerated under EHCI first.
 *
 * We write into the xHC&apos;s PCI configuration space in some Intel-specific
 * registers to switch the ports over.  The USB 3.0 terminations and the USB
 * 2.0 data wires are switched separately.  We want to enable the SuperSpeed
 * terminations before switching the USB 2.0 wires over, so that USB 3.0
 * devices connect at SuperSpeed, rather than at USB 2.0 speeds.
