 * Magic header for a swap area. The first part of the union is
 * what the swap magic looks like for the old (limited to 128MB)
 * swap area format, the second part of the union adds - in the
 * old reserved area - some extra information. Note that the first
 * kilobyte is reserved for boot loader or disk label stuff...
 *
 * Having the magic at the end of the PAGE_SIZE makes detecting swap
 * areas somewhat tricky on machines that support multiple page sizes.
 * For 2.5 we&apos;ll probably want to move the magic to just beyond the
 * bootbits...
