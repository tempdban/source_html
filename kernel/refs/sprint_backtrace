 * sprint_backtrace - Look up a backtrace symbol and return it in a text buffer
 * @buffer: buffer to be stored
 * @address: address to lookup
 *
 * This function is for stack backtrace and does the same thing as
 * sprint_symbol() but with modified/decreased @address. If there is a
 * tail-call to the function marked &quot;noreturn&quot;, gcc optimized out code after
 * the call so that the stack-saved return address could point outside of the
 * caller. This function ensures that kallsyms will find the original caller
 * by decreasing @address.
 *
 * This function returns the number of bytes stored in @buffer.
