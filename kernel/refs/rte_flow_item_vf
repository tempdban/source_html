 * RTE_FLOW_ITEM_TYPE_VF
 *
 * Matches traffic originating from (ingress) or going to (egress) a given
 * virtual function of the current device.
 *
 * If supported, should work even if the virtual function is not managed by
 * the application and thus not associated with a DPDK port ID.
 *
 * Note this pattern item does not match VF representors traffic which, as
 * separate entities, should be addressed through their own DPDK port IDs.
 *
 * - Can be specified multiple times to match traffic addressed to several
 *   VF IDs.
 * - Can be combined with a PF item to match both PF and VF traffic.
 *
 * A zeroed mask can be used to match any VF ID.
