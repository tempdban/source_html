 * Change the ownership of a key
 *
 * The key must grant the caller Setattr permission for this to work, though
 * the key need not be fully instantiated yet.  For the UID to be changed, or
 * for the GID to be changed to a group the caller is not a member of, the
 * caller must have sysadmin capability.  If either uid or gid is -1 then that
 * attribute is not changed.
 *
 * If the UID is to be changed, the new user must have sufficient quota to
 * accept the key.  The quota deduction will be removed from the old user to
 * the new user should the attribute be changed.
 *
 * If successful, 0 will be returned.
