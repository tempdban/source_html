 * memcpy_mcsafe - copy memory with indication if a machine check happened
 *
 * @dst:	destination address
 * @src:	source address
 * @cnt:	number of bytes to copy
 *
 * Low level memory copy function that catches machine checks
 * We only call into the &quot;safe&quot; function on systems that can
 * actually do machine check recovery. Everyone else can just
 * use memcpy().
 *
 * Return 0 for success, or number of bytes not copied if there was an
 * exception.
