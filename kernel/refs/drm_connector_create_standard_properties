 * DOC: standard connector properties
 *
 * DRM connectors have a few standardized properties:
 *
 * EDID:
 * 	Blob property which contains the current EDID read from the sink. This
 * 	is useful to parse sink identification information like vendor, model
 * 	and serial. Drivers should update this property by calling
 * 	drm_mode_connector_update_edid_property(), usually after having parsed
 * 	the EDID using drm_add_edid_modes(). Userspace cannot change this
 * 	property.
 * DPMS:
 * 	Legacy property for setting the power state of the connector. For atomic
 * 	drivers this is only provided for backwards compatibility with existing
 * 	drivers, it remaps to controlling the &quot;ACTIVE&quot; property on the CRTC the
 * 	connector is linked to. Drivers should never set this property directly,
 * 	it is handled by the DRM core by calling the &amp;drm_connector_funcs.dpms
 * 	callback. For atomic drivers the remapping to the &quot;ACTIVE&quot; property is
 * 	implemented in the DRM core.  This is the only standard connector
 * 	property that userspace can change.
 * PATH:
 * 	Connector path property to identify how this sink is physically
 * 	connected. Used by DP MST. This should be set by calling
 * 	drm_mode_connector_set_path_property(), in the case of DP MST with the
 * 	path property the MST manager created. Userspace cannot change this
 * 	property.
 * TILE:
 * 	Connector tile group property to indicate how a set of DRM connector
 * 	compose together into one logical screen. This is used by both high-res
 * 	external screens (often only using a single cable, but exposing multiple
 * 	DP MST sinks), or high-res integrated panels (like dual-link DSI) which
 * 	are not gen-locked. Note that for tiled panels which are genlocked, like
 * 	dual-link LVDS or dual-link DSI, the driver should try to not expose the
 * 	tiling and virtualize both &amp;drm_crtc and &amp;drm_plane if needed. Drivers
 * 	should update this value using drm_mode_connector_set_tile_property().
 * 	Userspace cannot change this property.
 * link-status:
 *      Connector link-status property to indicate the status of link. The default
 *      value of link-status is &quot;GOOD&quot;. If something fails during or after modeset,
 *      the kernel driver may set this to &quot;BAD&quot; and issue a hotplug uevent. Drivers
 *      should update this value using drm_mode_connector_set_link_status_property().
 *
 * Connectors also have one standardized atomic property:
 *
 * CRTC_ID:
 * 	Mode object ID of the &amp;drm_crtc this connector should be connected to.
