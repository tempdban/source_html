 * The policy is invited to save a 32bit hint value for every cblock (eg,
 * for a hit count).  These are stored against the policy name.  If
 * policies are changed, then hints will be lost.  If the machine crashes,
 * hints will be lost.
 *
 * The hints are indexed by the cblock, but many policies will not
 * neccessarily have a fast way of accessing efficiently via cblock.  So
 * rather than querying the policy for each cblock, we let it walk its data
 * structures and fill in the hints in whatever order it wishes.
