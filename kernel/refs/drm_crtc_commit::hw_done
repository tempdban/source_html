	 * Will be signalled when all hw register changes for this commit have
	 * been written out. Especially when disabling a pipe this can be much
	 * later than than @flip_done, since that can signal already when the
	 * screen goes black, whereas to fully shut down a pipe more register
	 * I/O is required.
	 *
	 * Note that this does not need to include separately reference-counted
	 * resources like backing storage buffer pinning, or runtime pm
	 * management.
