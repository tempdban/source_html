 * crypto_skcipher_chunksize() - obtain chunk size
 * @tfm: cipher handle
 *
 * The block size is set to one for ciphers such as CTR.  However,
 * you still need to provide incremental updates in multiples of
 * the underlying block size as the IV does not have sub-block
 * granularity.  This is known in this API as the chunk size.

 * Return: chunk size in bytes
