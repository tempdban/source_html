 * mmap_address_hint_valid - Validate the address hint of mmap
 * @addr:	Address hint
 * @len:	Mapping length
 *
 * Check whether @addr and @addr + @len result in a valid mapping.
 *
 * On 32bit this only checks whether @addr + @len is &lt;= TASK_SIZE.
 *
 * On 64bit with 5-level page tables another sanity check is required
 * because mappings requested by mmap(@addr, 0) which cross the 47-bit
 * virtual address boundary can cause the following theoretical issue:
 *
 *  An application calls mmap(addr, 0), i.e. without MAP_FIXED, where @addr
 *  is below the border of the 47-bit address space and @addr + @len is
 *  above the border.
 *
 *  With 4-level paging this request succeeds, but the resulting mapping
 *  address will always be within the 47-bit virtual address space, because
 *  the hint address does not result in a valid mapping and is
 *  ignored. Hence applications which are not prepared to handle virtual
 *  addresses above 47-bit work correctly.
 *
 *  With 5-level paging this request would be granted and result in a
 *  mapping which crosses the border of the 47-bit virtual address
 *  space. If the application cannot handle addresses above 47-bit this
 *  will lead to misbehaviour and hard to diagnose failures.
 *
 * Therefore ignore address hints which would result in a mapping crossing
 * the 47-bit virtual address boundary.
 *
 * Note, that in the same scenario with MAP_FIXED the behaviour is
 * different. The request with @addr &lt; 47-bit and @addr + @len &gt; 47-bit
 * fails on a 4-level paging machine but succeeds on a 5-level paging
 * machine. It is reasonable to expect that an application does not rely on
 * the failure of such a fixed mapping request, so the restriction is not
 * applied.
