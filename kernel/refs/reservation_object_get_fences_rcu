 * reservation_object_get_fences_rcu - Get an object&apos;s shared and exclusive
 * fences without update side lock held
 * @obj: the reservation object
 * @pfence_excl: the returned exclusive fence (or NULL)
 * @pshared_count: the number of shared fences returned
 * @pshared: the array of shared fence ptrs returned (array is krealloc&apos;d to
 * the required size, and must be freed by caller)
 *
 * Retrieve all fences from the reservation object. If the pointer for the
 * exclusive fence is not specified the fence is put into the array of the
 * shared fences as well. Returns either zero or -ENOMEM.
