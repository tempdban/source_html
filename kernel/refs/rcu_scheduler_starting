 * This function is invoked towards the end of the scheduler&apos;s
 * initialization process.  Before this is called, the idle task might
 * contain synchronous grace-period primitives (during which time, this idle
 * task is booting the system, and such primitives are no-ops).  After this
 * function is called, any synchronous grace-period primitives are run as
 * expedited, with the requesting task driving the grace period forward.
 * A later core_initcall() rcu_set_runtime_mode() will switch to full
 * runtime RCU functionality.
