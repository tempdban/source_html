 *	tty_release		-	vfs callback for close
 *	@inode: inode of tty
 *	@filp: file pointer for handle to tty
 *
 *	Called the last time each file handle is closed that references
 *	this tty. There may however be several such references.
 *
 *	Locking:
 *		Takes bkl. See tty_release_dev
 *
 * Even releasing the tty structures is a tricky business.. We have
 * to be very careful that the structures are all released at the
 * same time, as interrupts might otherwise get the wrong pointers.
 *
 * WSH 09/09/97: rewritten to avoid some nasty race conditions that could
 * lead to double frees or releasing memory still in use.
