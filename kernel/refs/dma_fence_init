 * dma_fence_init - Initialize a custom fence.
 * @fence:	[in]	the fence to initialize
 * @ops:	[in]	the dma_fence_ops for operations on this fence
 * @lock:	[in]	the irqsafe spinlock to use for locking this fence
 * @context:	[in]	the execution context this fence is run on
 * @seqno:	[in]	a linear increasing sequence number for this context
 *
 * Initializes an allocated fence, the caller doesn&apos;t have to keep its
 * refcount after committing with this fence, but it will need to hold a
 * refcount again if dma_fence_ops.enable_signaling gets called. This can
 * be used for other implementing other types of fence.
 *
 * context and seqno are used for easy comparison between fences, allowing
 * to check which fence is later by simply using dma_fence_later.
