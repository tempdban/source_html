 * rdma_cap_ib_mcast - Check if the port of device has the capability Infiniband
 * Multicast.
 * @device: Device to check
 * @port_num: Port number to check
 *
 * InfiniBand multicast registration is more complex than normal IPv4 or
 * IPv6 multicast registration.  Each Host Channel Adapter must register
 * with the Subnet Manager when it wishes to join a multicast group.  It
 * should do so only once regardless of how many queue pairs it subscribes
 * to this group.  And it should leave the group only after all queue pairs
 * attached to the group have been detached.
 *
 * Return: true if the port must undertake the additional adminstrative
 * overhead of registering/unregistering with the SM and tracking of the
 * total number of queue pairs attached to the multicast group.
