<doc f='linux-4.18.y/include/linux/leds.h' l='142'>/**
 * led_blink_set - set blinking with software fallback
 * @led_cdev: the LED to start blinking
 * @delay_on: the time it should be on (in ms)
 * @delay_off: the time it should ble off (in ms)
 *
 * This function makes the LED blink, attempting to use the
 * hardware acceleration if possible, but falling back to
 * software blinking if there is no hardware blinking or if
 * the LED refuses the passed values.
 *
 * Note that if software blinking is active, simply calling
 * led_cdev-&gt;brightness_set() will not stop the blinking,
 * use led_classdev_brightness_set() instead.
