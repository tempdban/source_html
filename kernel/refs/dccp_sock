 * @dccps_osr - first OPEN sequence number received
 * @dccps_gss - greatest sequence number sent
 * @dccps_gsr - greatest valid sequence number received
 * @dccps_gar - greatest valid ack number received on a non-Sync; initialized to %dccps_iss
 * @dccps_service - first (passive sock) or unique (active sock) service code
 * @dccps_service_list - second .. last service code on passive socket
 * @dccps_timestamp_echo - latest timestamp received on a TIMESTAMP option

 * @dccps_l_ack_ratio - feature-local Ack Ratio
 * @dccps_r_ack_ratio - feature-remote Ack Ratio
 * @dccps_l_seq_win - local Sequence Window (influences ack number validity)
 * @dccps_r_seq_win - remote Sequence Window (influences seq number validity)
 * @dccps_pcslen - sender   partial checksum coverage (via sockopt)
 * @dccps_pcrlen - receiver partial checksum coverage (via sockopt)
 * @dccps_send_ndp_count - local Send NDP Count feature (7.7.2)
 * @dccps_ndp_count - number of Non Data Packets since last data packet
 * @dccps_mss_cache - current value of MSS (path MTU minus header sizes)
 * @dccps_rate_last - timestamp for rate-limiting DCCP-Sync (RFC 4340, 7.5.4)
 * @dccps_featneg - tracks feature-negotiation state (mostly during handshake)
 * @dccps_hc_rx_ackvec - rx half connection ack vector
 * @dccps_hc_rx_ccid - CCID used for the receiver (or receiving half-connection)
 * @dccps_hc_tx_ccid - CCID used for the sender (or sending half-connection)
 * @dccps_options_received - parsed set of retrieved options
 * @dccps_qpolicy - TX dequeueing policy, one of %dccp_packet_dequeueing_policy
 * @dccps_tx_qlen - maximum length of the TX queue

 * @dccps_hc_rx_insert_options - receiver wants to add options when acking
 * @dccps_hc_tx_insert_options - sender wants to add options when sending
 * @dccps_server_timewait - server holds timewait state on close (RFC 4340, 8.3)
 * @dccps_sync_scheduled - flag which signals &quot;send out-of-band message soon&quot;
 * @dccps_xmitlet - tasklet scheduled by the TX CCID to dequeue data packets
 * @dccps_xmit_timer - used by the TX CCID to delay sending (rate-based pacing)
 * @dccps_syn_rtt - RTT sample from Request/Response exchange (in usecs)
