 * qman_dca - Perform a Discrete Consumption Acknowledgment
 * @dq: the DQRR entry to be consumed
 * @park_request: indicates whether the held-active @fq should be parked
 *
 * Only allowed in DCA-mode portals, for DQRR entries whose handler callback had
 * previously returned &apos;qman_cb_dqrr_defer&apos;. NB, as with the other APIs, this
 * does not take a &apos;portal&apos; argument but implies the core affine portal from the
 * cpu that is currently executing the function. For reasons of locking, this
 * function must be called from the same CPU as that which processed the DQRR
 * entry in the first place.
