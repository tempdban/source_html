 * Header for events written back to userspace on the drm fd.  The
 * type defines the type of event, the length specifies the total
 * length of the event (including the header), and user_data is
 * typically a 64 bit value passed with the ioctl that triggered the
 * event.  A read on the drm fd will always only return complete
 * events, that is, if for example the read buffer is 100 bytes, and
 * there are two 64 byte events pending, only one will be returned.
 *
 * Event types 0 - 0x7fffffff are generic drm events, 0x80000000 and
 * up are chipset specific.
