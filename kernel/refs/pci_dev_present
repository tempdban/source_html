 * pci_dev_present - Returns 1 if device matching the device list is present, 0 if not.
 * @ids: A pointer to a null terminated list of struct pci_device_id structures
 * that describe the type of PCI device the caller is trying to find.
 *
 * Obvious fact: You do not have a reference to any device that might be found
 * by this function, so if that device is removed from the system right after
 * this function is finished, the value will be stale.  Use this function to
 * find devices that are usually built into a system, or for a general hint as
 * to if another device happens to be present at this specific moment in time.
