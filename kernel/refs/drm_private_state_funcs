 * struct drm_private_state_funcs - atomic state functions for private objects
 *
 * These hooks are used by atomic helpers to create, swap and destroy states of
 * private objects. The structure itself is used as a vtable to identify the
 * associated private object type. Each private object type that needs to be
 * added to the atomic states is expected to have an implementation of these
 * hooks and pass a pointer to it&apos;s drm_private_state_funcs struct to
 * drm_atomic_get_private_obj_state().
