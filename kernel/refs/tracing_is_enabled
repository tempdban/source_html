 * tracing_is_enabled - Show if global_trace has been disabled
 *
 * Shows if the global trace has been enabled or not. It uses the
 * mirror flag &quot;buffer_disabled&quot; to be used in fast paths such as for
 * the irqsoff tracer. But it may be inaccurate due to races. If you
 * need to know the accurate state, use tracing_is_on() which is a little
 * slower, but accurate.
