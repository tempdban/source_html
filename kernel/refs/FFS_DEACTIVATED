	 * Function is visible to host, but it&apos;s not functional. All
	 * setup requests are stalled and transfers on another endpoints
	 * are refused. All epfiles, except ep0, are deleted so there
	 * is no way to perform any operations on them.
	 *
	 * This state is set after closing all functionfs files, when
	 * mount parameter &quot;no_disconnect=1&quot; has been set. Function will
	 * remain in deactivated state until filesystem is umounted or
	 * ep0 is opened again. In the second case functionfs state will
	 * be reset, and it will be ready for descriptors and strings
	 * writing.
	 *
	 * This is useful only when functionfs is composed to gadget
	 * with another function which can perform some critical
	 * operations, and it&apos;s strongly desired to have this operations
	 * completed, even after functionfs files closure.
