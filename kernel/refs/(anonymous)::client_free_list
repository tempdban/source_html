				   in the array of log client records.
				   LOGFILE_NO_CLIENT means that there are no
				   free log client records in the array.
				   If != LOGFILE_NO_CLIENT, check that
				   log_clients &gt; client_free_list.  On Win2k
				   and presumably earlier, on a clean volume
				   this is != LOGFILE_NO_CLIENT, and it should
				   be 0, i.e. the first (and only) client
				   record is free and thus the logfile is
				   closed and hence clean.  A dirty volume
				   would have left the logfile open and hence
				   this would be LOGFILE_NO_CLIENT.  On WinXP
				   and presumably later, the logfile is always
				   open, even on clean shutdown so this should
				   always be LOGFILE_NO_CLIENT. */</doc>
