 * All DIX-capable initiators must support the T10-mandated CRC
 * checksum.  Controllers can optionally implement the IP checksum
 * scheme which has much lower impact on system performance.  Note
 * that the main rationale for the checksum is to match integrity
 * metadata with data.  Detecting bit errors are a job for ECC memory
