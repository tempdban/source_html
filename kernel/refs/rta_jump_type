 * enum rta_jump_type - Types of action taken by JUMP command
 * @LOCAL_JUMP: conditional jump to an offset within the descriptor buffer
 * @FAR_JUMP: conditional jump to a location outside the descriptor buffer,
 *            indicated by the POINTER field after the JUMP command.
 * @HALT: conditional halt - stop the execution of the current descriptor and
 *        writes PKHA / Math condition bits as status / error code.
 * @HALT_STATUS: conditional halt with user-specified status - stop the
 *               execution of the current descriptor and writes the value of
 *               &quot;LOCAL OFFSET&quot; JUMP field as status / error code.
 * @GOSUB: conditional subroutine call - similar to @LOCAL_JUMP, but also saves
 *         return address in the Return Address register; subroutine calls
 *         cannot be nested.
 * @RETURN: conditional subroutine return - similar to @LOCAL_JUMP, but the
 *          offset is taken from the Return Address register.
 * @LOCAL_JUMP_INC: similar to @LOCAL_JUMP, but increment the register specified
 *                  in &quot;SRC_DST&quot; JUMP field before evaluating the jump
 *                  condition.
 * @LOCAL_JUMP_DEC: similar to @LOCAL_JUMP, but decrement the register specified
 *                  in &quot;SRC_DST&quot; JUMP field before evaluating the jump
 *                  condition.
