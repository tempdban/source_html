	 * Returning/freeing pages is more complicated synchronization
	 * wise, because free&apos;s can happen on remote CPUs, with no

	 *
	 * Use ptr_ring, as it separates consumer and producer
	 * effeciently, it a way that doesn&apos;t bounce cache-lines.

	 * TODO: Implement bulk return pages into this structure.
