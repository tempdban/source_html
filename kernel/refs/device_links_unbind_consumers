 * device_links_unbind_consumers - Force unbind consumers of the given device.
 * @dev: Device to unbind the consumers of.
 *
 * Walk the list of links to consumers for @dev and if any of them is in the
 * &quot;consumer probe&quot; state, wait for all device probes in progress to complete
 * and start over.
 *
 * If that&apos;s not the case, change the status of the link to &quot;supplier unbind&quot;
 * and check if the link was in the &quot;active&quot; state.  If so, force the consumer
 * driver to unbind and start over (the consumer will not re-probe as we have
 * changed the state of the link already).
 *
 * Links with the DL_FLAG_STATELESS flag set are ignored.
