 * Find out how many pages are allowed for a single swap device. There
 * are two limiting factors:
 * 1) the number of bits for the swap offset in the swp_entry_t type, and
 * 2) the number of bits in the swap pte, as defined by the different
 * architectures.
 *
 * In order to find the largest possible bit mask, a swap entry with
 * swap type 0 and swap offset ~0UL is created, encoded to a swap pte,
 * decoded to a swp_entry_t again, and finally the swap offset is
 * extracted.
 *
 * This will mask all the bits from the initial ~0UL mask that can&apos;t
 * be encoded in either the swp_entry_t or the architecture definition
 * of a swap pte.
