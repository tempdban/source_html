 * This CDC ACM function support just wraps control functions and
 * notifications around the generic serial-over-usb code.
 *
 * Because CDC ACM is standardized by the USB-IF, many host operating
 * systems have drivers for it.  Accordingly, ACM is the preferred
 * interop solution for serial-port type connections.  The control
 * models are often not necessary, and in any case don&apos;t do much in
 * this bare-bones implementation.
 *
 * Note that even MS-Windows has some support for ACM.  However, that
 * support is somewhat broken because when you use ACM in a composite
 * device, having multiple interfaces confuses the poor OS.  It doesn&apos;t
 * seem to understand CDC Union descriptors.  The new &quot;association&quot;
 * descriptors (roughly equivalent to CDC Unions) may sometimes help.
