 * @req: reference to the ahash_request handle whose state is exported
 * @out: output buffer of sufficient size that can hold the hash state

 * This function exports the hash state of the ahash_request handle into the
 * caller-allocated output buffer out which must have sufficient size (e.g. by
 * calling crypto_ahash_statesize()).

 * Return: 0 if the export was successful; &lt; 0 if an error occurred
