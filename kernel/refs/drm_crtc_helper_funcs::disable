	 * @disable:
	 *
	 * This callback should be used to disable the CRTC. With the atomic
	 * drivers it is called after all encoders connected to this CRTC have
	 * been shut off already using their own
	 * &amp;drm_encoder_helper_funcs.disable hook. If that sequence is too
	 * simple drivers can just add their own hooks and call it from this
	 * CRTC callback here by looping over all encoders connected to it using
	 * for_each_encoder_on_crtc().
	 *
	 * This hook is used both by legacy CRTC helpers and atomic helpers.
	 * Atomic drivers don&apos;t need to implement it if there&apos;s no need to
	 * disable anything at the CRTC level. To ensure that runtime PM
	 * handling (using either DPMS or the new &quot;ACTIVE&quot; property) works
	 * @disable must be the inverse of @atomic_enable for atomic drivers.
	 * Atomic drivers should consider to use @atomic_disable instead of
	 * this one.
	 *
	 * NOTE:
	 *
	 * With legacy CRTC helpers there&apos;s a big semantic difference between
	 * @disable and other hooks (like @prepare or @dpms) used to shut down a
	 * CRTC: @disable is only called when also logically disabling the
	 * display pipeline and needs to release any resources acquired in
	 * @mode_set (like shared PLLs, or again release pinned framebuffers).
	 *
	 * Therefore @disable must be the inverse of @mode_set plus @commit for
	 * drivers still using legacy CRTC helpers, which is different from the
	 * rules under atomic.
