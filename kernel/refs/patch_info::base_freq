 * which is heard if the sample is played using the base_freq as the
 * playback speed.
 *
 * The low_note and high_note fields define the minimum and maximum note
 * frequencies for which this sample is valid. It is possible to define
 * more than one samples for an instrument number at the same time. The
 * low_note and high_note fields are used to select the most suitable one.
 *
 * The fields base_note, high_note and low_note should contain
 * the note frequency multiplied by 1000. For example value for the
 * middle A is 440*1000.
