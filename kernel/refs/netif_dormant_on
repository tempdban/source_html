 *	@dev: network device
 *
 * Mark device as dormant (as per RFC2863).
 *
 * The dormant state indicates that the relevant interface is not
 * actually in a condition to pass packets (i.e., it is not &apos;up&apos;) but is
 * in a &quot;pending&quot; state, waiting for some external event.  For &quot;on-
 * demand&quot; interfaces, this new state identifies the situation where the
 * interface is waiting for events to place it in the up state.
