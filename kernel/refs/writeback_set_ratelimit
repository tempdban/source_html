 * If ratelimit_pages is too high then we can get into dirty-data overload
 * if a large number of processes all perform writes at the same time.
 * If it is too low then SMP machines will call the (expensive)
 * get_writeback_state too often.
 *
 * Here we set ratelimit_pages to a level which ensures that when all CPUs are
 * dirtying in parallel, we cannot go more than 3% (1/32) over the dirty memory
 * thresholds.
