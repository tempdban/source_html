<doc f='linux-4.18.y/drivers/md/raid1.h' l='29'>/* Note: raid1_info.rdev can be set to NULL asynchronously by raid1_remove_disk.
 * There are three safe ways to access raid1_info.rdev.
 * 1/ when holding mddev-&gt;reconfig_mutex
 * 2/ when resync/recovery is known to be happening - i.e. in code that is
 *    called as part of performing resync/recovery.
 * 3/ while holding rcu_read_lock(), use rcu_dereference to get the pointer
 *    and if it is non-NULL, increment rdev-&gt;nr_pending before dropping the
 *    RCU lock.
 * When .rdev is set to NULL, the nr_pending count checked again and if it has
 * been incremented, the pointer is put back in .rdev.
