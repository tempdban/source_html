 * struct usb_interface_cache - long-term representation of a device interface
 * @num_altsetting: number of altsettings defined.
 * @ref: reference counter.
 * @altsetting: variable-length array of interface structures, one for
 *	each alternate setting that may be selected.  Each one includes a
 *	set of endpoint configurations.  They will be in no particular order.
 *
 * These structures persist for the lifetime of a usb_device, unlike
 * struct usb_interface (which persists only as long as its configuration
 * is installed).  The altsetting arrays can be accessed through these
 * structures at any time, permitting comparison of configurations and
 * providing support for the /sys/kernel/debug/usb/devices pseudo-file.
