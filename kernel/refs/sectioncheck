 * Describe how to match sections on different criterias:
 *
 * @fromsec: Array of sections to be matched.
 *
 * @bad_tosec: Relocations applied to a section in @fromsec to a section in
 * this array is forbidden (black-list).  Can be empty.
 *
 * @good_tosec: Relocations applied to a section in @fromsec must be
 * targetting sections in this array (white-list).  Can be empty.
 *
 * @mismatch: Type of mismatch.
 *
 * @symbol_white_list: Do not match a relocation to a symbol in this list
 * even if it is targetting a section in @bad_to_sec.
 *
 * @handler: Specific handler to call when a match is found.  If NULL,
 * default_mismatch_handler() will be called.
