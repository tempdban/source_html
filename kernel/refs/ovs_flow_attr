 * enum ovs_flow_attr - attributes for %OVS_FLOW_* commands.
 * @OVS_FLOW_ATTR_KEY: Nested %OVS_KEY_ATTR_* attributes specifying the flow
 * key.  Always present in notifications.  Required for all requests (except
 * dumps).
 * @OVS_FLOW_ATTR_ACTIONS: Nested %OVS_ACTION_ATTR_* attributes specifying
 * the actions to take for packets that match the key.  Always present in
 * notifications.  Required for %OVS_FLOW_CMD_NEW requests, optional for
 * %OVS_FLOW_CMD_SET requests.  An %OVS_FLOW_CMD_SET without
 * %OVS_FLOW_ATTR_ACTIONS will not modify the actions.  To clear the actions,
 * an %OVS_FLOW_ATTR_ACTIONS without any nested attributes must be given.
 * @OVS_FLOW_ATTR_STATS: &amp;struct ovs_flow_stats giving statistics for this
 * flow.  Present in notifications if the stats would be nonzero.  Ignored in
 * requests.
 * @OVS_FLOW_ATTR_TCP_FLAGS: An 8-bit value giving the OR&apos;d value of all of the
 * TCP flags seen on packets in this flow.  Only present in notifications for
 * TCP flows, and only if it would be nonzero.  Ignored in requests.
 * @OVS_FLOW_ATTR_USED: A 64-bit integer giving the time, in milliseconds on
 * the system monotonic clock, at which a packet was last processed for this
 * flow.  Only present in notifications if a packet has been processed for this
 * flow.  Ignored in requests.
 * @OVS_FLOW_ATTR_CLEAR: If present in a %OVS_FLOW_CMD_SET request, clears the
 * last-used time, accumulated TCP flags, and statistics for this flow.
 * Otherwise ignored in requests.  Never present in notifications.
 * @OVS_FLOW_ATTR_MASK: Nested %OVS_KEY_ATTR_* attributes specifying the
 * mask bits for wildcarded flow match. Mask bit value &apos;1&apos; specifies exact
 * match with corresponding flow key bit, while mask bit value &apos;0&apos; specifies
 * a wildcarded match. Omitting attribute is treated as wildcarding all
 * corresponding fields. Optional for all requests. If not present,
 * all flow key bits are exact match bits.
 * @OVS_FLOW_ATTR_UFID: A value between 1-16 octets specifying a unique
 * identifier for the flow. Causes the flow to be indexed by this value rather
 * than the value of the %OVS_FLOW_ATTR_KEY attribute. Optional for all
 * requests. Present in notifications if the flow was created with this
 * attribute.
 * @OVS_FLOW_ATTR_UFID_FLAGS: A 32-bit value of OR&apos;d %OVS_UFID_F_*
 * flags that provide alternative semantics for flow installation and
 * retrieval. Optional for all requests.
 *
 * These attributes follow the &amp;struct ovs_header within the Generic Netlink
 * payload for %OVS_FLOW_* commands.
