 * Region tracking -- allows tracking of reservations and instantiated pages
 *                    across the pages in a mapping.
 *
 * The region data structures are embedded into a resv_map and protected
 * by a resv_map&apos;s lock.  The set of regions within the resv_map represent
 * reservations for huge pages, or huge pages that have already been
 * instantiated within the map.  The from and to elements are huge page
 * indicies into the associated mapping.  from indicates the starting index
 * of the region.  to represents the first index past the end of  the region.
 *
 * For example, a file region structure with from == 0 and to == 4 represents
 * four huge pages in a mapping.  It is important to note that the to element
 * represents the first element past the end of the region. This is used in
 * arithmetic as 4(to) - 0(from) = 4 huge pages in the region.
 *
 * Interval notation of the form [from, to) will be used to indicate that
 * the endpoint from is inclusive and to is exclusive.
