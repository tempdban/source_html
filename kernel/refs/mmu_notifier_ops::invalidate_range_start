	 * because of pending I/O or other circumstances then the
	 * invalidate_range_start() callback (or the initial mapping
	 * by the driver) must make sure that the refcount is kept

	 *
	 * If the driver increases the refcount when the pages are
	 * initially mapped into an address space then either
	 * invalidate_range_start() or invalidate_range_end() may
	 * decrease the refcount. If the refcount is decreased on
	 * invalidate_range_start() then the VM can free pages as page
	 * table entries are removed.  If the refcount is only
	 * droppped on invalidate_range_end() then the driver itself
	 * will drop the last refcount but it must take care to flush
	 * any secondary tlb before doing the final free on the
	 * page. Pages will no longer be referenced by the linux
	 * address space but may still be referenced by sptes until
	 * the last refcount is dropped.
