 * VF uses this message to request PF to map IWARP vectors to IWARP queues.
 * The request for this originates from the VF IWARP driver through
 * a client interface between VF LAN and VF IWARP driver.
 * A vector could have an AEQ and CEQ attached to it although
 * there is a single AEQ per VF IWARP instance in which case
 * most vectors will have an INVALID_IDX for aeq and valid idx for ceq.
 * There will never be a case where there will be multiple CEQs attached
 * to a single vector.
 * PF configures interrupt mapping and returns status.
