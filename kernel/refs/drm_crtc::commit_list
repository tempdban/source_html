	 * @commit_list:
	 *
	 * List of &amp;drm_crtc_commit structures tracking pending commits.
	 * Protected by @commit_lock. This list holds its own full reference,
	 * as does the ongoing commit.
	 *
	 * &quot;Note that the commit for a state change is also tracked in
	 * &amp;drm_crtc_state.commit. For accessing the immediately preceding
	 * commit in an atomic update it is recommended to just use that
	 * pointer in the old CRTC state, since accessing that doesn&apos;t need
	 * any locking or list-walking. @commit_list should only be used to
	 * stall for framebuffer cleanup that&apos;s signalled through
	 * &amp;drm_crtc_commit.cleanup_done.&quot;
