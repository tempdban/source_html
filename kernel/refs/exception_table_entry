 * The exception table consists of triples of addresses relative to the
 * exception table entry itself. The first address is of an instruction
 * that is allowed to fault, the second is the target at which the program
 * should continue. The third is a handler function to deal with the fault
 * caused by the instruction in the first field.
 *
 * All the routines below use bits of fixup code that are out of line
 * with the main instruction path.  This means when everything is well,
 * we don&apos;t even have to jump over them.  Further, they do not intrude
 * on our cache or tlb entries.
