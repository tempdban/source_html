 * A wb_domain represents a domain that wb&apos;s (bdi_writeback&apos;s) belong to
 * and are measured against each other in.  There always is one global
 * domain, global_wb_domain, that every wb in the system is a member of.
 * This allows measuring the relative bandwidth of each wb to distribute
 * dirtyable memory accordingly.
