 * This wraps up the common operations that need to occur when retrieving
 * data from xsave state.  It first ensures that the current task was
 * using the FPU and retrieves the data in to a buffer.  It then calculates
 * the offset of the requested field in the buffer.
 *
 * This function is safe to call whether the FPU is in use or not.
 *
 * Note that this only works on the current task.
 *
 * Inputs:
 *	@xsave_state: state which is defined in xsave.h (e.g. XFEATURE_MASK_FP,
 *	XFEATURE_MASK_SSE, etc...)
 * Output:
 *	address of the state in the xsave area or NULL if the state
 *	is not present or is in its &apos;init state&apos;.
