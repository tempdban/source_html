<doc f='linux-4.14.y/include/linux/leds.h' l='160'>/**
 * led_blink_set_oneshot - do a oneshot software blink
 * @led_cdev: the LED to start blinking
 * @delay_on: the time it should be on (in ms)
 * @delay_off: the time it should ble off (in ms)
 * @invert: blink off, then on, leaving the led on
 *
 * This function makes the LED blink one time for delay_on +
 * delay_off time, ignoring the request if another one-shot
 * blink is already in progress.
 *
 * If invert is set, led blinks for delay_off first, then for
 * delay_on and leave the led on after the on-off cycle.
