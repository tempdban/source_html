<doc f='linux-4.18.y/include/linux/reset.h' l='189'>/**
 * of_reset_control_get_shared - Lookup and obtain an shared reference
 *                               to a reset controller.
 * @node: device to be reset by the controller
 * @id: reset line name
 *
 * When a reset-control is shared, the behavior of reset_control_assert /
 * deassert is changed, the reset-core will keep track of a deassert_count
 * and only (re-)assert the reset after reset_control_assert has been called
 * as many times as reset_control_deassert was called. Also see the remark
 * about shared reset-controls in the reset_control_assert docs.
 *
 * Calling reset_control_assert without first calling reset_control_deassert
 * is not allowed on a shared reset control. Calling reset_control_reset is
 * also not allowed on a shared reset control.
 * Returns a struct reset_control or IS_ERR() condition containing errno.
 *
 * Use of id names is optional.
