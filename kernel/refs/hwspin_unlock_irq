 * hwspin_unlock_irq() - unlock hwspinlock, enable interrupts
 * @hwlock: a previously-acquired hwspinlock which we want to unlock
 *
 * This function will unlock a specific hwspinlock, enable preemption and
 * enable local interrupts. Should be used to undo hwspin_lock_irq().
 *
 * @hwlock must be already locked (e.g. by hwspin_trylock_irq()) before
 * calling this function: it is a bug to call unlock on a @hwlock that is
 * already unlocked.
