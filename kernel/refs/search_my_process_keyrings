 * Search the process keyrings attached to the supplied cred for the first
 * matching key.
 *
 * The search criteria are the type and the match function.  The description is
 * given to the match function as a parameter, but doesn&apos;t otherwise influence
 * the search.  Typically the match function will compare the description
 * parameter to the key&apos;s description.
 *
 * This can only search keyrings that grant Search permission to the supplied
 * credentials.  Keyrings linked to searched keyrings will also be searched if
 * they grant Search permission too.  Keys can only be found if they grant
 * Search permission to the credentials.
 *
 * Returns a pointer to the key with the key usage count incremented if
 * successful, -EAGAIN if we didn&apos;t find any matching key or -ENOKEY if we only
 * matched negative keys.
 *
 * In the case of a successful return, the possession attribute is set on the
 * returned key reference.
