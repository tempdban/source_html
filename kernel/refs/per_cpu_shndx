 * The .data..percpu section is a special case for x86_64 SMP kernels.
 * It is used to initialize the actual per_cpu areas and to provide
 * definitions for the per_cpu variables that correspond to their offsets
 * within the percpu area. Since the values of all of the symbols need
 * to be offsets from the start of the per_cpu area the virtual address
 * (sh_addr) of .data..percpu is 0 in SMP kernels.
 *
 * This means that:
 *
 *	Relocations that reference symbols in the per_cpu area do not
 *	need further relocation (since the value is an offset relative
 *	to the start of the per_cpu area that does not change).
 *
 *	Relocations that apply to the per_cpu area need to have their
 *	offset adjusted by by the value of __per_cpu_load to make them
 *	point to the correct place in the loaded image (because the
 *	virtual address of .data..percpu is 0).
 *
 * For non SMP kernels .data..percpu is linked as part of the normal
 * kernel data and does not require special treatment.
