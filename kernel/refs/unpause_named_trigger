 * @data: The trigger data of a named trigger to unpause

 * Un-pauses a named trigger along with all other triggers having the
 * same name.  Because named triggers share a common set of data,
 * unpausing only one is meaningless, so unpausing one named trigger
 * needs to unpause all triggers with the same name.
