 * This is called before hardware starts writing to the AUX area to
 * obtain an output handle and make sure there&apos;s room in the buffer.
 * When the capture completes, call perf_aux_output_end() to commit
 * the recorded data to the buffer.
 *
 * The ordering is similar to that of perf_output_{begin,end}, with
 * the exception of (B), which should be taken care of by the pmu
 * driver, since ordering rules will differ depending on hardware.
 *
 * Call this from pmu::start(); see the comment in perf_aux_output_end()
 * about its use in pmu callbacks. Both can also be called from the PMI
 * handler if needed.
