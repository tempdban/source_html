 * Predefined ACPI Names (Built-in to the Interpreter)
 *
 * NOTES:
 * 1) _SB_ is defined to be a device to allow \_SB_._INI to be run
 *    during the initialization sequence.
 * 2) _TZ_ is defined to be a thermal zone in order to allow ASL code to
 *    perform a Notify() operation on it. 09/2010: Changed to type Device.
 *    This still allows notifies, but does not confuse host code that
 *    searches for valid thermal_zone objects.
