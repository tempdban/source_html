   DO NOT USE THIS FUNCTION!!  There is no limit on how much it will read.

   The function has been officially removed in ISO C11.  This opportunity
   is used to also remove it from the GNU feature list.  It is now only
   available when explicitly using an old ISO C, Unix, or POSIX standard.
   GCC defines _GNU_SOURCE when building C++ code and the function is still
   in C++11, so it is also available for C++.

   This function is a possible cancellation point and therefore not
   marked with __THROW.  */</doc>
