 * These are the main single-value transfer routines.  They automatically
 * use the right size if we just have the right pointer type.
 *
 * This gets kind of ugly. We want to return _two_ values in &quot;get_user()&quot;
 * and yet we don&apos;t want to do any pointers, because that is too much
 * of a performance impact. Thus we have a few rather ugly macros here,
 * and hide all the ugliness from the user.
 *
 * The &quot;__xxx&quot; versions of the user access functions are versions that
 * do not verify the address space, that must have been done previously
 * with a separate &quot;access_ok()&quot; call (this is used when we do multiple
 * accesses to the same area of user memory).
