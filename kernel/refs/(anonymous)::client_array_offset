				   the first log client record if versions are
				   matched.  When creating, set this to be
				   after this restart area structure, aligned
				   to 8-bytes boundary.  If the versions do not
				   match, this is ignored and the offset is
				   assumed to be (sizeof(RESTART_AREA) + 7) &amp;
				   ~7, i.e. rounded up to first 8-byte
				   boundary.  Either way, client_array_offset
				   has to be aligned to an 8-byte boundary.
				   Also, restart_area_offset +
				   client_array_offset has to be &lt;= 510.
				   Finally, client_array_offset + (log_clients
				   * sizeof(log client record)) has to be &lt;=
				   system_page_size.  On Win2k and presumably
				   earlier, this is 0x30, i.e. immediately
				   following this record.  On WinXP and
				   presumably later, this is 0x40, i.e. there
				   are 16 extra bytes between this record and
				   the client array.  This probably means that
				   the RESTART_AREA record is actually bigger
				   in WinXP and later. */</doc>
