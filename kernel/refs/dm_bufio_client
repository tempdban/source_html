 * Linking of buffers:
 *	All buffers are linked to cache_hash with their hash_list field.
 *
 *	Clean buffers that are not being written (B_WRITING not set)
 *	are linked to lru[LIST_CLEAN] with their lru_list field.
 *
 *	Dirty and clean buffers that are being written are linked to
 *	lru[LIST_DIRTY] with their lru_list field. When the write
 *	finishes, the buffer cannot be relinked immediately (because we
 *	are in an interrupt context and relinking requires process
 *	context), so some clean-not-writing buffers can be held on
 *	dirty_lru too.  They are later added to lru in the process
 *	context.
