 * vma_needs_reservation, vma_commit_reservation and vma_end_reservation
 * are used by the huge page allocation routines to manage reservations.
 *
 * vma_needs_reservation is called to determine if the huge page at addr
 * within the vma has an associated reservation.  If a reservation is
 * needed, the value 1 is returned.  The caller is then responsible for
 * managing the global reservation and subpool usage counts.  After
 * the huge page has been allocated, vma_commit_reservation is called
 * to add the page to the reservation map.  If the page allocation fails,
 * the reservation must be ended instead of committed.  vma_end_reservation
 * is called in such cases.
 *
 * In the normal case, vma_commit_reservation returns the same value
 * as the preceding vma_needs_reservation call.  The only time this
 * is not the case is if a reserve map was changed between calls.  It
 * is the responsibility of the caller to notice the difference and
 * take appropriate action.
 *
 * vma_add_reservation is used in error paths where a reservation must
 * be restored when a newly allocated huge page must be freed.  It is
 * to be called after calling vma_needs_reservation to determine if a
 * reservation exists.
