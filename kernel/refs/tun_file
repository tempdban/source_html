<doc f='linux-4.14.y/drivers/net/tun.c' l='152'>/* A tun_file connects an open character device to a tuntap netdevice. It
 * also contains all socket related structures (except sock_fprog and tap_filter)
 * to serve as one transmit queue for tuntap device. The sock_fprog and
 * tap_filter were kept in tun_struct since they were used for filtering for the
 * netdevice not for a specific queue (at least I didn&apos;t see the requirement for
 * this).
 *
 * RCU usage:
 * The tun_file and tun_struct are loosely coupled, the pointer from one to the
 * other can only be read while rcu_read_lock or rtnl_lock is held.
