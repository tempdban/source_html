 * drm_atomic_helper_commit_planes_on_crtc - commit plane state for a crtc
 * @old_crtc_state: atomic state object with the old crtc state
 *
 * This function commits the new plane state using the plane and atomic helper
 * functions for planes on the specific crtc. It assumes that the atomic state
 * has already been pushed into the relevant object state pointers, since this
 * step can no longer fail.
 *
 * This function is useful when plane updates should be done crtc-by-crtc
 * instead of one global step like drm_atomic_helper_commit_planes() does.
 *
 * This function can only be savely used when planes are not allowed to move
 * between different CRTCs because this function doesn&apos;t handle inter-CRTC
 * depencies. Callers need to ensure that either no such depencies exist,
 * resolve them through ordering of commit calls or through some other means.
