 * RTE_FLOW_ITEM_TYPE_PHY_PORT
 *
 * Matches traffic originating from (ingress) or going to (egress) a
 * physical port of the underlying device.
 *
 * The first PHY_PORT item overrides the physical port normally associated
 * with the specified DPDK input port (port_id). This item can be provided
 * several times to match additional physical ports.
 *
 * Note that physical ports are not necessarily tied to DPDK input ports
 * (port_id) when those are not under DPDK control. Possible values are
 * specific to each device, they are not necessarily indexed from zero and
 * may not be contiguous.
 *
 * As a device property, the list of allowed values as well as the value
 * associated with a port_id should be retrieved by other means.
 *
 * A zeroed mask can be used to match any port index.
