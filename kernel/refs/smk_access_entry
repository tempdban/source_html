 * smk_access_entry - look up matching access rule
 * @subject_label: a pointer to the subject&apos;s Smack label
 * @object_label: a pointer to the object&apos;s Smack label
 * @rule_list: the list of rules to search
 *
 * This function looks up the subject/object pair in the
 * access rule list and returns the access mode. If no
 * entry is found returns -ENOENT.
 *
 * NOTE:
 *
 * Earlier versions of this function allowed for labels that
 * were not on the label list. This was done to allow for
 * labels to come over the network that had never been seen
 * before on this host. Unless the receiving socket has the
 * star label this will always result in a failure check. The
 * star labeled socket case is now handled in the networking
 * hooks so there is no case where the label is not on the
 * label list. Checking to see if the address of two labels
 * is the same is now a reliable test.
 *
 * Do the object check first because that is more
 * likely to differ.
 *
 * Allowing write access implies allowing locking.
