 * DOC: Single Block Cipher API
 *
 * The single block cipher API is used with the ciphers of type
 * CRYPTO_ALG_TYPE_CIPHER (listed as type &quot;cipher&quot; in /proc/crypto).
 *
 * Using the single block cipher API calls, operations with the basic cipher
 * primitive can be implemented. These cipher primitives exclude any block
 * chaining operations including IV handling.
 *
 * The purpose of this single block cipher API is to support the implementation
 * of templates or other concepts that only need to perform the cipher operation
 * on one block at a time. Templates invoke the underlying cipher primitive
 * block-wise and process either the input or the output data of these cipher
 * operations.
