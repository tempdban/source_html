 *	radix_tree_gang_lookup_tag - perform multiple lookup on a radix tree
 *	                             based on a tag
 *	@root:		radix tree root
 *	@results:	where the results of the lookup are placed
 *	@first_index:	start the lookup from this key
 *	@max_items:	place up to this many items at *results
 *	@tag:		the tag index (&lt; RADIX_TREE_MAX_TAGS)
 *
 *	Performs an index-ascending scan of the tree for present items which
 *	have the tag indexed by @tag set.  Places the items at *@results and
 *	returns the number of items which were placed at *@results.
