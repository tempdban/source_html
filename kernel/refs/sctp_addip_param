 * Section 3.1.1 Address Configuration Change Chunk (ASCONF)
 *
 * 	Serial Number: 32 bits (unsigned integer)
 *	This value represents a Serial Number for the ASCONF Chunk. The
 *	valid range of Serial Number is from 0 to 2^32-1.
 *	Serial Numbers wrap back to 0 after reaching 2^32 -1.
 *
 *	Address Parameter: 8 or 20 bytes (depending on type)
 *	The address is an address of the sender of the ASCONF chunk,
 *	the address MUST be considered part of the association by the
 *	peer endpoint. This field may be used by the receiver of the 
 *	ASCONF to help in finding the association. This parameter MUST
 *	be present in every ASCONF message i.e. it is a mandatory TLV
 *	parameter.
 *
 *	ASCONF Parameter: TLV format
 *	Each Address configuration change is represented by a TLV
 *	parameter as defined in Section 3.2. One or more requests may
 *	be present in an ASCONF Chunk.
 *
 * Section 3.1.2 Address Configuration Acknowledgement Chunk (ASCONF-ACK)
 * 
 *	Serial Number: 32 bits (unsigned integer)
 *	This value represents the Serial Number for the received ASCONF
 *	Chunk that is acknowledged by this chunk. This value is copied
 *	from the received ASCONF Chunk. 
 *
 *	ASCONF Parameter Response: TLV format
 *	The ASCONF Parameter Response is used in the ASCONF-ACK to
 *	report status of ASCONF processing.
