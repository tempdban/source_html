 * Check if sub-channels have already been offerred. This API will be useful
 * when the driver is unloaded after establishing sub-channels. In this case,
 * when the driver is re-loaded, the driver would have to check if the
 * subchannels have already been established before attempting to request
 * the creation of sub-channels.
 * This function returns TRUE to indicate that subchannels have already been
 * created.
 * This function should be invoked after setting the callback function for
 * sub-channel creation.
