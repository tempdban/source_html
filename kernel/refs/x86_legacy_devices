 * struct x86_legacy_devices - legacy x86 devices
 *
 * @pnpbios: this platform can have a PNPBIOS. If this is disabled the platform
 * 	is known to never have a PNPBIOS.
 *
 * These are devices known to require LPC or ISA bus. The definition of legacy
 * devices adheres to the ACPI 5.2.9.3 IA-PC Boot Architecture flag
 * ACPI_FADT_LEGACY_DEVICES. These devices consist of user visible devices on
 * the LPC or ISA bus. User visible devices are devices that have end-user
 * accessible connectors (for example, LPT parallel port). Legacy devices on
 * the LPC bus consist for example of serial and parallel ports, PS/2 keyboard
 * / mouse, and the floppy disk controller. A system that lacks all known
 * legacy devices can assume all devices can be detected exclusively via
 * standard device enumeration mechanisms including the ACPI namespace.
 *
 * A system which has does not have ACPI_FADT_LEGACY_DEVICES enabled must not
 * have any of the legacy devices enumerated below present.
