 * wait_iff_congested - Conditionally wait for a backing_dev to become uncongested or a pgdat to complete writes
 * @pgdat: A pgdat to check if it is heavily congested
 * @sync: SYNC or ASYNC IO
 * @timeout: timeout in jiffies
 *
 * In the event of a congested backing_dev (any backing_dev) and the given
 * @pgdat has experienced recent congestion, this waits for up to @timeout
 * jiffies for either a BDI to exit congestion of the given @sync queue
 * or a write to complete.
 *
 * In the absence of pgdat congestion, cond_resched() is called to yield
 * the processor if necessary but otherwise does not sleep.
 *
 * The return value is 0 if the sleep is for the full timeout. Otherwise,
 * it is the number of jiffies that were still remaining when the function
 * returned. return_value == timeout implies the function did not sleep.
