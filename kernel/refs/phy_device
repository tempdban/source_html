<doc f='linux-4.18.y/include/linux/phy.h' l='366'>/* phy_device: An instance of a PHY
 *
 * drv: Pointer to the driver for this PHY instance
 * phy_id: UID for this device found during discovery
 * c45_ids: 802.3-c45 Device Identifers if is_c45.
 * is_c45:  Set to true if this phy uses clause 45 addressing.
 * is_internal: Set to true if this phy is internal to a MAC.
 * is_pseudo_fixed_link: Set to true if this phy is an Ethernet switch, etc.
 * has_fixups: Set to true if this phy has fixups/quirks.
 * suspended: Set to true if this phy has been suspended successfully.
 * sysfs_links: Internal boolean tracking sysfs symbolic links setup/removal.
 * loopback_enabled: Set true if this phy has been loopbacked successfully.
 * state: state of the PHY for management purposes
 * dev_flags: Device-specific flags used by the PHY driver.
 * link_timeout: The number of timer firings to wait before the
 * giving up on the current attempt at acquiring a link
 * irq: IRQ number of the PHY&apos;s interrupt (-1 if none)
 * phy_timer: The timer for handling the state machine
 * phy_queue: A work_queue for the phy_mac_interrupt
 * attached_dev: The attached enet driver&apos;s device instance ptr
 * adjust_link: Callback for the enet controller to respond to
 * changes in the link state.
 *
 * speed, duplex, pause, supported, advertising, lp_advertising,
 * and autoneg are used like in mii_if_info
 *
 * interrupts currently only supports enabled or disabled,
 * but could be changed in the future to support enabling
 * and disabling specific interrupts
 *
 * Contains some infrastructure for polling and interrupt
 * handling, as well as handling shifts in PHY hardware state
