 * spi_w8r16be - SPI synchronous 8 bit write followed by 16 bit big-endian read
 * @spi: device with which data will be exchanged
 * @cmd: command to be written before data is read back
 * Context: can sleep
 *
 * This function is similar to spi_w8r16, with the exception that it will
 * convert the read 16 bit data word from big-endian to native endianness.
 *
 * Callable only from contexts that can sleep.
 *
 * Return: the (unsigned) sixteen bit number returned by the device in cpu
 * endianness, or else a negative error code.
