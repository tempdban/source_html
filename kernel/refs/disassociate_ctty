 *	disassociate_ctty	-	disconnect controlling tty
 *	@on_exit: true if exiting so need to &quot;hang up&quot; the session
 *
 *	This function is typically called only by the session leader, when
 *	it wants to disassociate itself from its controlling tty.
 *
 *	It performs the following functions:
 * 	(1)  Sends a SIGHUP and SIGCONT to the foreground process group
 * 	(2)  Clears the tty from being controlling the session
 * 	(3)  Clears the controlling tty for all processes in the
 * 		session group.
 *
 *	The argument on_exit is set to 1 if called when a process is
 *	exiting; it is 0 if called by the ioctl TIOCNOTTY.
 *
 *	Locking:
 *		BTM is taken for hysterical raisons, and held when
 *		  called from no_tty().
 *		  tty_mutex is taken to protect tty
 *		  -&gt;siglock is taken to protect -&gt;signal/-&gt;sighand
 *		  tasklist_lock is taken to walk process list for sessions
 *		    -&gt;siglock is taken to protect -&gt;signal/-&gt;sighand
