 * hwspin_unlock() - unlock hwspinlock
 * @hwlock: a previously-acquired hwspinlock which we want to unlock
 *
 * This function will unlock a specific hwspinlock and enable preemption
 * back.
 *
 * @hwlock must be already locked (e.g. by hwspin_trylock()) before calling
 * this function: it is a bug to call unlock on a @hwlock that is already
 * unlocked.
