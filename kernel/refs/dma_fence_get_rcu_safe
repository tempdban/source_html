 * dma_fence_get_rcu_safe  - acquire a reference to an RCU tracked fence
 * @fencep: pointer to fence to increase refcount of
 *
 * Function returns NULL if no refcount could be obtained, or the fence.
 * This function handles acquiring a reference to a fence that may be
 * reallocated within the RCU grace period (such as with SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU),
 * so long as the caller is using RCU on the pointer to the fence.
 *
 * An alternative mechanism is to employ a seqlock to protect a bunch of
 * fences, such as used by struct reservation_object. When using a seqlock,
 * the seqlock must be taken before and checked after a reference to the
 * fence is acquired (as shown here).
 *
 * The caller is required to hold the RCU read lock.
