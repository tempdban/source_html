 * The caller must guarantee that the keyring is a keyring and that the
 * permission is granted to modify the keyring as no check is made here.  The
 * caller must also hold a lock on the keyring semaphore.

 * Returns a pointer to the found key with usage count incremented if

 * If successful, the possession indicator is propagated from the keyring ref
