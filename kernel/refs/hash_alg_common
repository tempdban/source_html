 * struct hash_alg_common - define properties of message digest
 * @digestsize: Size of the result of the transformation. A buffer of this size
 *	        must be available to the @final and @finup calls, so they can
 *	        store the resulting hash into it. For various predefined sizes,
 *	        search include/crypto/ using
 *	        git grep _DIGEST_SIZE include/crypto.
 * @statesize: Size of the block for partial state of the transformation. A
 *	       buffer of this size must be passed to the @export function as it
 *	       will save the partial state of the transformation into it. On the
 *	       other side, the @import function will load the state from a
 *	       buffer of this size as well.
 * @base: Start of data structure of cipher algorithm. The common data
 *	  structure of crypto_alg contains information common to all ciphers.
 *	  The hash_alg_common data structure now adds the hash-specific
 *	  information.
