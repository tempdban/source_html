 * ttm_bo_init_reserved
 *
 * @bdev: Pointer to a ttm_bo_device struct.
 * @bo: Pointer to a ttm_buffer_object to be initialized.
 * @size: Requested size of buffer object.
 * @type: Requested type of buffer object.
 * @flags: Initial placement flags.
 * @page_alignment: Data alignment in pages.
 * @interruptible: If needing to sleep to wait for GPU resources,
 * sleep interruptible.
 * @persistent_swap_storage: Usually the swap storage is deleted for buffers
 * pinned in physical memory. If this behaviour is not desired, this member
 * holds a pointer to a persistent shmem object. Typically, this would
 * point to the shmem object backing a GEM object if TTM is used to back a
 * GEM user interface.
 * @acc_size: Accounted size for this object.
 * @resv: Pointer to a reservation_object, or NULL to let ttm allocate one.
 * @destroy: Destroy function. Use NULL for kfree().
 *
 * This function initializes a pre-allocated struct ttm_buffer_object.
 * As this object may be part of a larger structure, this function,
 * together with the @destroy function,
 * enables driver-specific objects derived from a ttm_buffer_object.
 *
 * On successful return, the caller owns an object kref to @bo. The kref and
 * list_kref are usually set to 1, but note that in some situations, other
 * tasks may already be holding references to @bo as well.
 * Furthermore, if resv == NULL, the buffer&apos;s reservation lock will be held,
 * and it is the caller&apos;s responsibility to call ttm_bo_unreserve.
 *
 * If a failure occurs, the function will call the @destroy function, or
 * kfree() if @destroy is NULL. Thus, after a failure, dereferencing @bo is
 * illegal and will likely cause memory corruption.
 *
 * Returns
 * -ENOMEM: Out of memory.
 * -EINVAL: Invalid placement flags.
 * -ERESTARTSYS: Interrupted by signal while sleeping waiting for resources.
