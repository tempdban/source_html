 * struct hwspinlock_pdata - platform data for hwspinlock drivers
 * @base_id: base id for this hwspinlock device
 *
 * hwspinlock devices provide system-wide hardware locks that are used
 * by remote processors that have no other way to achieve synchronization.
 *
 * To achieve that, each physical lock must have a system-wide id number
 * that is agreed upon, otherwise remote processors can&apos;t possibly assume
 * they&apos;re using the same hardware lock.
 *
 * Usually boards have a single hwspinlock device, which provides several
 * hwspinlocks, and in this case, they can be trivially numbered 0 to
 * (num-of-locks - 1).
 *
 * In case boards have several hwspinlocks devices, a different base id
 * should be used for each hwspinlock device (they can&apos;t all use 0 as
 * a starting id!).
 *
 * This platform data structure should be used to provide the base id
 * for each device (which is trivially 0 when only a single hwspinlock
 * device exists). It can be shared between different platforms, hence
 * its location.
