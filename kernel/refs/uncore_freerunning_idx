 * In the uncore document, there is no event-code assigned to free running
 * counters. Some events need to be defined to indicate the free running
 * counters. The events are encoded as event-code + umask-code.
 *
 * The event-code for all free running counters is 0xff, which is the same as
 * the fixed counters.
 *
 * The umask-code is used to distinguish a fixed counter and a free running
 * counter, and different types of free running counters.
 * - For fixed counters, the umask-code is 0x0X.
 *   X indicates the index of the fixed counter, which starts from 0.
 * - For free running counters, the umask-code uses the rest of the space.
 *   It would bare the format of 0xXY.
 *   X stands for the type of free running counters, which starts from 1.
 *   Y stands for the index of free running counters of same type, which
 *   starts from 0.
 *
 * For example, there are three types of IIO free running counters on Skylake
 * server, IO CLOCKS counters, BANDWIDTH counters and UTILIZATION counters.
 * The event-code for all the free running counters is 0xff.
 * &apos;ioclk&apos; is the first counter of IO CLOCKS. IO CLOCKS is the first type,
 * which umask-code starts from 0x10.
 * So &apos;ioclk&apos; is encoded as event=0xff,umask=0x10
 * &apos;bw_in_port2&apos; is the third counter of BANDWIDTH counters. BANDWIDTH is
 * the second type, which umask-code starts from 0x20.
 * So &apos;bw_in_port2&apos; is encoded as event=0xff,umask=0x22
