 * spi_bus_lock - obtain a lock for exclusive SPI bus usage
 * @ctlr: SPI bus master that should be locked for exclusive bus access
 * Context: can sleep
 *
 * This call may only be used from a context that may sleep.  The sleep
 * is non-interruptible, and has no timeout.
 *
 * This call should be used by drivers that require exclusive access to the
 * SPI bus. The SPI bus must be released by a spi_bus_unlock call when the
 * exclusive access is over. Data transfer must be done by spi_sync_locked
 * and spi_async_locked calls when the SPI bus lock is held.
 *
 * Return: always zero.
