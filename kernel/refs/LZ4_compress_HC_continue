 * LZ4_compress_HC_continue() - Compress &apos;src&apos; using data from previously
 *	compressed blocks as a dictionary using the HC algorithm
 * @streamHCPtr: Pointer to the previous &apos;LZ4_streamHC_t&apos; structure
 * @src: source address of the original data
 * @dst: output buffer address of the compressed data,
 *	which must be already allocated
 * @srcSize: size of the input data. Max supported value is LZ4_MAX_INPUT_SIZE
 * @maxDstSize: full or partial size of buffer &apos;dest&apos;
 *	which must be already allocated
 *
 * These functions compress data in successive blocks of any size, using
 * previous blocks as dictionary. One key assumption is that previous
 * blocks (up to 64 KB) remain read-accessible while
 * compressing next blocks. There is an exception for ring buffers,
 * which can be smaller than 64 KB.
 * Ring buffers scenario is automatically detected and handled by
 * LZ4_compress_HC_continue().
 * Before starting compression, state must be properly initialized,
 * using LZ4_resetStreamHC().
 * A first &quot;fictional block&quot; can then be designated as
 * initial dictionary, using LZ4_loadDictHC() (Optional).
 * Then, use LZ4_compress_HC_continue()
 * to compress each successive block. Previous memory blocks
 * (including initial dictionary when present) must remain accessible
 * and unmodified during compression.
 * &apos;dst&apos; buffer should be sized to handle worst case scenarios, using
 *  LZ4_compressBound(), to ensure operation success.
 *  If, for any reason, previous data blocks can&apos;t be preserved unmodified
 *  in memory during next compression block,
 *  you must save it to a safer memory space, using LZ4_saveDictHC().
 * Return value of LZ4_saveDictHC() is the size of dictionary
 * effectively saved into &apos;safeBuffer&apos;.
 *
 * Return: Number of bytes written into buffer &apos;dst&apos;  or 0 if compression fails
