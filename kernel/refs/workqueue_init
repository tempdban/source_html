 * workqueue_init - bring workqueue subsystem fully online
 *
 * This is the latter half of two-staged workqueue subsystem initialization
 * and invoked as soon as kthreads can be created and scheduled.
 * Workqueues have been created and work items queued on them, but there
 * are no kworkers executing the work items yet.  Populate the worker pools
 * with the initial workers and enable future kworker creations.
