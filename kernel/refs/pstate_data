 * struct pstate_data - Store P state data
 * @current_pstate:	Current requested P state
 * @min_pstate:		Min P state possible for this platform
 * @max_pstate:		Max P state possible for this platform
 * @max_pstate_physical:This is physical Max P state for a processor
 *			This can be higher than the max_pstate which can
 *			be limited by platform thermal design power limits
 * @scaling:		Scaling factor to  convert frequency to cpufreq

 * @turbo_pstate:	Max Turbo P state possible for this platform
 * @max_freq:		@max_pstate frequency in cpufreq units
 * @turbo_freq:		@turbo_pstate frequency in cpufreq units
 *
 * Stores the per cpu model P state limits and current P state.
