 * struct spi_mem_op - describes a SPI memory operation
 * @cmd.buswidth: number of IO lines used to transmit the command
 * @cmd.opcode: operation opcode
 * @addr.nbytes: number of address bytes to send. Can be zero if the operation
 *		 does not need to send an address
 * @addr.buswidth: number of IO lines used to transmit the address cycles
 * @addr.val: address value. This value is always sent MSB first on the bus.
 *	      Note that only @addr.nbytes are taken into account in this
 *	      address value, so users should make sure the value fits in the
 *	      assigned number of bytes.
 * @dummy.nbytes: number of dummy bytes to send after an opcode or address. Can
 *		  be zero if the operation does not require dummy bytes
 * @dummy.buswidth: number of IO lanes used to transmit the dummy bytes
 * @data.buswidth: number of IO lanes used to send/receive the data
 * @data.dir: direction of the transfer
 * @data.buf.in: input buffer
 * @data.buf.out: output buffer
