 * Mark a region of a framebuffer as dirty.
 *
 * Some hardware does not automatically update display contents
 * as a hardware or software draw to a framebuffer. This ioctl
 * allows userspace to tell the kernel and the hardware what
 * regions of the framebuffer have changed.
 *
 * The kernel or hardware is free to update more then just the
 * region specified by the clip rects. The kernel or hardware
 * may also delay and/or coalesce several calls to dirty into a
 * single update.
 *
 * Userspace may annotate the updates, the annotates are a
 * promise made by the caller that the change is either a copy
 * of pixels or a fill of a single color in the region specified.
 *
 * If the DRM_MODE_FB_DIRTY_ANNOTATE_COPY flag is given then
 * the number of updated regions are half of num_clips given,
 * where the clip rects are paired in src and dst. The width and
 * height of each one of the pairs must match.
 *
 * If the DRM_MODE_FB_DIRTY_ANNOTATE_FILL flag is given the caller
 * promises that the region specified of the clip rects is filled
 * completely with a single color as given in the color argument.
