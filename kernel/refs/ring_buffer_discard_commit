 * ring_buffer_commit_discard - discard an event that has not been committed
 * @buffer: the ring buffer
 * @event: non committed event to discard
 *
 * Sometimes an event that is in the ring buffer needs to be ignored.
 * This function lets the user discard an event in the ring buffer
 * and then that event will not be read later.
 *
 * This function only works if it is called before the item has been
 * committed. It will try to free the event from the ring buffer
 * if another event has not been added behind it.
 *
 * If another event has been added behind it, it will set the event
 * up as discarded, and perform the commit.
 *
 * If this function is called, do not call ring_buffer_unlock_commit on
 * the event.
