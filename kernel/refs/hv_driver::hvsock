	 * A hvsock offer, which has a VMBUS_CHANNEL_TLNPI_PROVIDER_OFFER
	 * channel flag, actually doesn&apos;t mean a synthetic device because the
	 * offer&apos;s if_type/if_instance can change for every new hvsock
	 * connection.
	 *
	 * However, to facilitate the notification of new-offer/rescind-offer
	 * from vmbus driver to hvsock driver, we can handle hvsock offer as
	 * a special vmbus device, and hence we need the below flag to
	 * indicate if the driver is the hvsock driver or not: we need to
	 * specially treat the hvosck offer &amp; driver in vmbus_match().
