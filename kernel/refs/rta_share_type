 * enum rta_share_type - Types of sharing for JOB_HDR and SHR_HDR commands
 * @SHR_NEVER: nothing is shared; descriptors can execute in parallel (i.e. no
 *             dependencies are allowed between them).
 * @SHR_WAIT: shared descriptor and keys are shared once the descriptor sets
 *            &quot;OK to share&quot; in DECO Control Register (DCTRL).
 * @SHR_SERIAL: shared descriptor and keys are shared once the descriptor has
 *              completed.
 * @SHR_ALWAYS: shared descriptor is shared anytime after the descriptor is
 *              loaded.
 * @SHR_DEFER: valid only for JOB_HDR; sharing type is the one specified
 *             in the shared descriptor associated with the job descriptor.
