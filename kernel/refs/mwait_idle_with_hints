 * This uses new MONITOR/MWAIT instructions on P4 processors with PNI,
 * which can obviate IPI to trigger checking of need_resched.
 * We execute MONITOR against need_resched and enter optimized wait state
 * through MWAIT. Whenever someone changes need_resched, we would be woken
 * up from MWAIT (without an IPI).
 *
 * New with Core Duo processors, MWAIT can take some hints based on CPU
 * capability.
