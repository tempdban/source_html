 * struct drm_plane_state - mutable plane state
 * @plane: backpointer to the plane
 * @crtc_w: width of visible portion of plane on crtc
 * @crtc_h: height of visible portion of plane on crtc
 * @src_x: left position of visible portion of plane within
 *	plane (in 16.16)
 * @src_y: upper position of visible portion of plane within
 *	plane (in 16.16)
 * @src_w: width of visible portion of plane (in 16.16)
 * @src_h: height of visible portion of plane (in 16.16)
 * @rotation: rotation of the plane
 * @zpos: priority of the given plane on crtc (optional)
 *	Note that multiple active planes on the same crtc can have an identical
 *	zpos value. The rule to solving the conflict is to compare the plane
 *	object IDs; the plane with a higher ID must be stacked on top of a
 *	plane with a lower ID.
 * @normalized_zpos: normalized value of zpos: unique, range from 0 to N-1
 *	where N is the number of active planes for given crtc. Note that
 *	the driver must call drm_atomic_normalize_zpos() to update this before
 *	it can be trusted.
 * @src: clipped source coordinates of the plane (in 16.16)
 * @dst: clipped destination coordinates of the plane
 * @state: backpointer to global drm_atomic_state
