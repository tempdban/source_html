	 * @enable_signaling:
	 *
	 * Enable software signaling of fence.
	 *
	 * For fence implementations that have the capability for hw-&gt;hw
	 * signaling, they can implement this op to enable the necessary
	 * interrupts, or insert commands into cmdstream, etc, to avoid these
	 * costly operations for the common case where only hw-&gt;hw
	 * synchronization is required.  This is called in the first
	 * dma_fence_wait() or dma_fence_add_callback() path to let the fence
	 * implementation know that there is another driver waiting on the
	 * signal (ie. hw-&gt;sw case).
	 *
	 * This function can be called from atomic context, but not
	 * from irq context, so normal spinlocks can be used.
	 *
	 * A return value of false indicates the fence already passed,
	 * or some failure occurred that made it impossible to enable
	 * signaling. True indicates successful enabling.
	 *
	 * &amp;dma_fence.error may be set in enable_signaling, but only when false
	 * is returned.
	 *
	 * Since many implementations can call dma_fence_signal() even when before
	 * @enable_signaling has been called there&apos;s a race window, where the
	 * dma_fence_signal() might result in the final fence reference being
	 * released and its memory freed. To avoid this, implementations of this
	 * callback should grab their own reference using dma_fence_get(), to be
	 * released when the fence is signalled (through e.g. the interrupt
	 * handler).
	 *
	 * This callback is mandatory.
