 * rdma_cap_eth_ah - Check if the port of device has the capability
 * Ethernet Address Handle.
 * @device: Device to check
 * @port_num: Port number to check
 *
 * RoCE is InfiniBand over Ethernet, and it uses a well defined technique
 * to fabricate GIDs over Ethernet/IP specific addresses native to the
 * port.  Normally, packet headers are generated by the sending host
 * adapter, but when sending connectionless datagrams, we must manually
 * inject the proper headers for the fabric we are communicating over.
 *
 * Return: true if we are running as a RoCE port and must force the
 * addition of a Global Route Header built from our Ethernet Address
 * Handle into our header list for connectionless packets.
