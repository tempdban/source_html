 * i2c_acpi_new_device - Create i2c-client for the Nth I2cSerialBus resource
 * @dev:     Device owning the ACPI resources to get the client from
 * @index:   Index of ACPI resource to get
 * @info:    describes the I2C device; note this is modified (addr gets set)
 * Context: can sleep
 *
 * By default the i2c subsys creates an i2c-client for the first I2cSerialBus
 * resource of an acpi_device, but some acpi_devices have multiple I2cSerialBus
 * resources, in that case this function can be used to create an i2c-client
 * for other I2cSerialBus resources in the Current Resource Settings table.
 *
 * Also see i2c_new_device, which this function calls to create the i2c-client.
 *
 * Returns a pointer to the new i2c-client, or NULL if the adapter is not found.
