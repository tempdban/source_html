 * @file: The file pointer assoctiated to the event
 * @buffer: The ring buffer that the event is being written to
 * @event: The event meta data in the ring buffer
 * @entry: The event itself
 * @irq_flags: The state of the interrupts at the start of the event
 * @pc: The state of the preempt count at the start of the event.
 *
 * This is a helper function to handle triggers that require data
 * from the event itself. It also tests the event against filters and
 * if the event is soft disabled and should be discarded.
