 * struct arch_elf_state - arch-specific ELF loading state
 *
 * This structure is used to preserve architecture specific data during
 * the loading of an ELF file, throughout the checking of architecture
 * specific ELF headers &amp; through to the point where the ELF load is
 * known to be proceeding (ie. SET_PERSONALITY).
 *
 * This implementation is a dummy for architectures which require no
 * specific state.
