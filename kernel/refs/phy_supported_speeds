 * phy_supported_speeds - return all speeds currently supported by a phy device
 * @phy: The phy device to return supported speeds of.
 * @speeds: buffer to store supported speeds in.
 * @size: size of speeds buffer.
 *
 * Description: Returns the number of supported speeds, and
 * fills the speeds * buffer with the supported speeds. If speeds buffer is
 * too small to contain * all currently supported speeds, will return as
