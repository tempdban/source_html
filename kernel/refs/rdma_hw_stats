 * struct rdma_hw_stats
 * @lock - Mutex to protect parallel write access to lifespan and values
 *    of counters, which are 64bits and not guaranteeed to be written
 *    atomicaly on 32bits systems.
 * @timestamp - Used by the core code to track when the last update was
 * @lifespan - Used by the core code to determine how old the counters
 *   should be before being updated again.  Stored in jiffies, defaults
 *   to 10 milliseconds, drivers can override the default be specifying
 *   their own value during their allocation routine.
 * @name - Array of pointers to static names used for the counters in
 *   directory.
 * @num_counters - How many hardware counters there are.  If name is
 *   shorter than this number, a kernel oops will result.  Driver authors
 *   are encouraged to leave BUILD_BUG_ON(ARRAY_SIZE(@name) &lt; num_counters)
 *   in their code to prevent this.
 * @value - Array of u64 counters that are accessed by the sysfs code and
 *   filled in by the drivers get_stats routine
