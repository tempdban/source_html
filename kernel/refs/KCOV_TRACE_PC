	 * Tracing coverage collection mode.
	 * Covered PCs are collected in a per-task buffer.
	 * In new KCOV version the mode is chosen by calling
	 * ioctl(fd, KCOV_ENABLE, mode). In older versions the mode argument
	 * was supposed to be 0 in such a call. So, for reasons of backward
	 * compatibility, we have chosen the value KCOV_TRACE_PC to be 0.
