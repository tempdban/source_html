	 * States involved in closing a DCCP connection:
	 * 1) ACTIVE_CLOSEREQ is entered by a server sending a CloseReq.
	 *
	 * 2) CLOSING can have three different meanings (RFC 4340, 8.3):
	 *  a. Client has performed active-close, has sent a Close to the server
	 *     from state OPEN or PARTOPEN, and is waiting for the final Reset
	 *     (in this case, SOCK_DONE == 1).
	 *  b. Client is asked to perform passive-close, by receiving a CloseReq
	 *     in (PART)OPEN state. It sends a Close and waits for final Reset
	 *     (in this case, SOCK_DONE == 0).
	 *  c. Server performs an active-close as in (a), keeps TIMEWAIT state.
	 *
	 * 3) The following intermediate states are employed to give passively
	 *    closing nodes a chance to process their unread data:
	 *    - PASSIVE_CLOSE    (from OPEN =&gt; CLOSED) and
	 *    - PASSIVE_CLOSEREQ (from (PART)OPEN to CLOSING; case (b) above).
