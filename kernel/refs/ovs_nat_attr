 * enum ovs_nat_attr - Attributes for %OVS_CT_ATTR_NAT.
 *
 * @OVS_NAT_ATTR_SRC: Flag for Source NAT (mangle source address/port).
 * @OVS_NAT_ATTR_DST: Flag for Destination NAT (mangle destination
 * address/port).  Only one of (@OVS_NAT_ATTR_SRC, @OVS_NAT_ATTR_DST) may be
 * specified.  Effective only for packets for ct_state NEW connections.
 * Packets of committed connections are mangled by the NAT action according to
 * the committed NAT type regardless of the flags specified.  As a corollary, a
 * NAT action without a NAT type flag will only mangle packets of committed
 * connections.  The following NAT attributes only apply for NEW
 * (non-committed) connections, and they may be included only when the CT
 * action has the @OVS_CT_ATTR_COMMIT flag and either @OVS_NAT_ATTR_SRC or
 * @OVS_NAT_ATTR_DST is also included.
 * @OVS_NAT_ATTR_IP_MIN: struct in_addr or struct in6_addr
 * @OVS_NAT_ATTR_IP_MAX: struct in_addr or struct in6_addr
 * @OVS_NAT_ATTR_PROTO_MIN: u16 L4 protocol specific lower boundary (port)
 * @OVS_NAT_ATTR_PROTO_MAX: u16 L4 protocol specific upper boundary (port)
 * @OVS_NAT_ATTR_PERSISTENT: Flag for persistent IP mapping across reboots
 * @OVS_NAT_ATTR_PROTO_HASH: Flag for pseudo random L4 port mapping (MD5)
 * @OVS_NAT_ATTR_PROTO_RANDOM: Flag for fully randomized L4 port mapping
