 * Retrieve the supported packet types of an Ethernet device.
 *
 * When a packet type is announced as supported, it *must* be recognized by
 * the PMD. For instance, if RTE_PTYPE_L2_ETHER, RTE_PTYPE_L2_ETHER_VLAN
 * and RTE_PTYPE_L3_IPV4 are announced, the PMD must return the following
 * packet types for these packets:
 * - Ether/IPv4              -&gt; RTE_PTYPE_L2_ETHER | RTE_PTYPE_L3_IPV4
 * - Ether/Vlan/IPv4         -&gt; RTE_PTYPE_L2_ETHER_VLAN | RTE_PTYPE_L3_IPV4
 * - Ether/[anything else]   -&gt; RTE_PTYPE_L2_ETHER
 * - Ether/Vlan/[anything else] -&gt; RTE_PTYPE_L2_ETHER_VLAN
 *
 * When a packet is received by a PMD, the most precise type must be
 * returned among the ones supported. However a PMD is allowed to set
 * packet type that is not in the supported list, at the condition that it
 * is more precise. Therefore, a PMD announcing no supported packet types
 * can still set a matching packet type in a received packet.
 *
 * @note
 *   Better to invoke this API after the device is already started or rx burst
 *   function is decided, to obtain correct supported ptypes.
 * @note
 *   if a given PMD does not report what ptypes it supports, then the supported
 *   ptype count is reported as 0.
 * @param port_id
 *   The port identifier of the Ethernet device.
 * @param ptype_mask
 *   A hint of what kind of packet type which the caller is interested in.
 * @param ptypes
 *   An array pointer to store adequate packet types, allocated by caller.
 * @param num
 *  Size of the array pointed by param ptypes.
 * @return
 *   - (&gt;=0) Number of supported ptypes. If the number of types exceeds num,
 *           only num entries will be filled into the ptypes array, but the full
 *           count of supported ptypes will be returned.
 *   - (-ENODEV) if *port_id* invalid.
