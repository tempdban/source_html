 *
 * Adding to this list will result in serious debate.  The main issue is
 * that this list is essentially a list of workarounds for either poorly
 * designed tunnels, or poorly designed device offloads.
 *
 * The parsing supported via these types should really be used for Rx
 * traffic only as the network stack will have already inserted offsets for
 * the location of the headers in the skb.  In addition any ports that are
 * pushed should be kept within the namespace without leaking to other
 * devices such as VFs or other ports on the same device.
 *
 * It is strongly encouraged to use CHECKSUM_COMPLETE for Rx to avoid the
 * need to use this for Rx checksum offload.  It should not be necessary to
 * call this function to perform Tx offloads on outgoing traffic.
