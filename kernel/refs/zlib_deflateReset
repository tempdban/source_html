extern int deflateInit2 (z_streamp strm,
                                     int  level,
                                     int  method,
                                     int  windowBits,
                                     int  memLevel,
                                     int  strategy);

     This is another version of deflateInit with more compression options. The
   fields next_in, zalloc, zfree and opaque must be initialized before by
   the caller.

     The method parameter is the compression method. It must be Z_DEFLATED in
   this version of the library.

     The windowBits parameter is the base two logarithm of the window size
   (the size of the history buffer).  It should be in the range 8..15 for this
   version of the library. Larger values of this parameter result in better
   compression at the expense of memory usage. The default value is 15 if
   deflateInit is used instead.

     The memLevel parameter specifies how much memory should be allocated
   for the internal compression state. memLevel=1 uses minimum memory but
   is slow and reduces compression ratio; memLevel=9 uses maximum memory
   for optimal speed. The default value is 8. See zconf.h for total memory
   usage as a function of windowBits and memLevel.

     The strategy parameter is used to tune the compression algorithm. Use the
   value Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY for normal data, Z_FILTERED for data produced by a
   filter (or predictor), or Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY to force Huffman encoding only (no
   string match).  Filtered data consists mostly of small values with a
   somewhat random distribution. In this case, the compression algorithm is
   tuned to compress them better. The effect of Z_FILTERED is to force more
   Huffman coding and less string matching; it is somewhat intermediate
   between Z_DEFAULT and Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY. The strategy parameter only affects
   the compression ratio but not the correctness of the compressed output even
   if it is not set appropriately.

      deflateInit2 returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough
   memory, Z_STREAM_ERROR if a parameter is invalid (such as an invalid
   method). msg is set to null if there is no error message.  deflateInit2 does
   not perform any compression: this will be done by deflate().
