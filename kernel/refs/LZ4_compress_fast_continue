 * LZ4_compress_fast_continue() - Compress &apos;src&apos; using data from previously
 *	compressed blocks as a dictionary
 * @streamPtr: Pointer to the previous &apos;LZ4_stream_t&apos; structure
 * @src: source address of the original data
 * @dst: output buffer address of the compressed data,
 *	which must be already allocated
 * @srcSize: size of the input data. Max supported value is LZ4_MAX_INPUT_SIZE
 * @maxDstSize: full or partial size of buffer &apos;dest&apos;
 *	which must be already allocated
 * @acceleration: acceleration factor
 *
 * Compress buffer content &apos;src&apos;, using data from previously compressed blocks
 * as dictionary to improve compression ratio.
 * Important : Previous data blocks are assumed to still
 * be present and unmodified !
 * If maxDstSize &gt;= LZ4_compressBound(srcSize),
 * compression is guaranteed to succeed, and runs faster.
 *
 * Return: Number of bytes written into buffer &apos;dst&apos;  or 0 if compression fails
