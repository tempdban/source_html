 * i2c_new_dummy - return a new i2c device bound to a dummy driver
 * @adapter: the adapter managing the device
 * @address: seven bit address to be used
 * Context: can sleep
 *
 * This returns an I2C client bound to the &quot;dummy&quot; driver, intended for use
 * with devices that consume multiple addresses.  Examples of such chips
 * include various EEPROMS (like 24c04 and 24c08 models).
 *
 * These dummy devices have two main uses.  First, most I2C and SMBus calls
 * except i2c_transfer() need a client handle; the dummy will be that handle.
 * And second, this prevents the specified address from being bound to a
 * different driver.
 *
 * This returns the new i2c client, which should be saved for later use with
 * i2c_unregister_device(); or NULL to indicate an error.
