    * SVGA3D_DEVCAP_MAX_TEXTURES reflects the maximum number of
    * fixed-function texture units available. Each of these units
    * work in both FFP and Shader modes, and they support texture
    * transforms and texture coordinates. The host may have additional
    * texture image units that are only usable with shaders.
