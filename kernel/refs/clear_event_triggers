 * clear_event_triggers - Clear all triggers associated with a trace array
 * @tr: The trace array to clear
 *
 * For each trigger, the triggering event has its tm_ref decremented
 * via trace_event_trigger_enable_disable(), and any associated event
 * (in the case of enable/disable_event triggers) will have its sm_ref
 * decremented via free()-&gt;trace_event_enable_disable().  That
 * combination effectively reverses the soft-mode/trigger state added
 * by trigger registration.
 *
 * Must be called with event_mutex held.
