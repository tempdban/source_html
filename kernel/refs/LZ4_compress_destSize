 * LZ4_compress_destSize() - Compress as much data as possible
 *	from source to dest
 * @source: source address of the original data
 * @dest: output buffer address of the compressed data
 * @sourceSizePtr: will be modified to indicate how many bytes where read
 *	from &apos;source&apos; to fill &apos;dest&apos;. New value is necessarily &lt;= old value.
 * @targetDestSize: Size of buffer &apos;dest&apos; which must be already allocated
 * @wrkmem: address of the working memory.
 *	This requires &apos;workmem&apos; of LZ4_MEM_COMPRESS.
 *
 * Reverse the logic, by compressing as much data as possible
 * from &apos;source&apos; buffer into already allocated buffer &apos;dest&apos;
 * of size &apos;targetDestSize&apos;.
 * This function either compresses the entire &apos;source&apos; content into &apos;dest&apos;
 * if it&apos;s large enough, or fill &apos;dest&apos; buffer completely with as much data as
 * possible from &apos;source&apos;.
 *
 * Return: Number of bytes written into &apos;dest&apos; (necessarily &lt;= targetDestSize)
 *	or 0 if compression fails
