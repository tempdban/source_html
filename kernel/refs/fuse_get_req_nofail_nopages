 * Gets a requests for a file operation, always succeeds

 * This is used for sending the FLUSH request, which must get to
 * userspace, due to POSIX locks which may need to be unlocked.
 *
 * If allocation fails due to OOM, use the reserved request in
 * fuse_file.
 *
 * This is very unlikely to deadlock accidentally, since the
