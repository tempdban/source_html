	 * subbuf_start - called on buffer-switch to a new sub-buffer
	 * @buf: the channel buffer containing the new sub-buffer
	 * @subbuf: the start of the new sub-buffer
	 * @prev_subbuf: the start of the previous sub-buffer
	 * @prev_padding: unused space at the end of previous sub-buffer
	 *
	 * The client should return 1 to continue logging, 0 to stop
	 * logging.
	 *
	 * NOTE: subbuf_start will also be invoked when the buffer is
	 *       created, so that the first sub-buffer can be initialized
	 *       if necessary.  In this case, prev_subbuf will be NULL.
	 *
	 * NOTE: the client can reserve bytes at the beginning of the new
	 *       sub-buffer by calling subbuf_start_reserve() in this callback.
