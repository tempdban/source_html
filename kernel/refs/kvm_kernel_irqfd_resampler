 * Resampling irqfds are a special variety of irqfds used to emulate
 * level triggered interrupts.  The interrupt is asserted on eventfd
 * trigger.  On acknowledgment through the irq ack notifier, the
 * interrupt is de-asserted and userspace is notified through the
 * resamplefd.  All resamplers on the same gsi are de-asserted
 * together, so we don&apos;t need to track the state of each individual
 * user.  We can also therefore share the same irq source ID.
