 * EHCI scheduled transaction support:  interrupt, iso, split iso
 * These are called &quot;periodic&quot; transactions in the EHCI spec.
 *
 * Note that for interrupt transfers, the QH/QTD manipulation is shared
 * with the &quot;asynchronous&quot; transaction support (control/bulk transfers).
 * The only real difference is in how interrupt transfers are scheduled.
 *
 * For ISO, we make an &quot;iso_stream&quot; head to serve the same role as a QH.
 * It keeps track of every ITD (or SITD) that&apos;s linked, and holds enough
 * pre-calculated schedule data to make appending to the queue be quick.
