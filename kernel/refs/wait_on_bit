 * wait_on_bit - wait for a bit to be cleared
 * @word: the word being waited on, a kernel virtual address
 * @bit: the bit of the word being waited on
 * @mode: the task state to sleep in
 *
 * There is a standard hashed waitqueue table for generic use. This
 * is the part of the hashtable&apos;s accessor API that waits on a bit.
 * For instance, if one were to have waiters on a bitflag, one would
 * call wait_on_bit() in threads waiting for the bit to clear.
 * One uses wait_on_bit() where one is waiting for the bit to clear,
 * but has no intention of setting it.
 * Returned value will be zero if the bit was cleared, or non-zero
 * if the process received a signal and the mode permitted wakeup
 * on that signal.
