   Build a set of tables to decode the provided canonical Huffman code.
   The code lengths are lens[0..codes-1].  The result starts at *table,
   whose indices are 0..2^bits-1.  work is a writable array of at least
   lens shorts, which is used as a work area.  type is the type of code
   to be generated, CODES, LENS, or DISTS.  On return, zero is success,
   -1 is an invalid code, and +1 means that ENOUGH isn&apos;t enough.  table
   on return points to the next available entry&apos;s address.  bits is the
   requested root table index bits, and on return it is the actual root
   table index bits.  It will differ if the request is greater than the
   longest code or if it is less than the shortest code.
