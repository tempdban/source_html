 * enum drm_mm_insert_mode - control search and allocation behaviour
 *
 * The &amp;struct drm_mm range manager supports finding a suitable modes using
 * a number of search trees. These trees are oranised by size, by address and
 * in most recent eviction order. This allows the user to find either the
 * smallest hole to reuse, the lowest or highest address to reuse, or simply
 * reuse the most recent eviction that fits. When allocating the &amp;drm_mm_node
 * from within the hole, the &amp;drm_mm_insert_mode also dictate whether to
 * allocate the lowest matching address or the highest.
