 * Basic structure for transmission/reception of a client XDR message.
 * Features a header (for a linear buffer containing RPC headers
 * and the data payload for short messages), and then an array of
 * pages.
 * The tail iovec allows you to append data after the page array. Its
 * main interest is for appending padding to the pages in order to
 * satisfy the int_32-alignment requirements in RFC1832.
 *
 * For the future, we might want to string several of these together
 * in a list if anybody wants to make use of NFSv4 COMPOUND
 * operations and/or has a need for scatter/gather involving pages.
