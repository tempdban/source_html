 * Locate any valid recovery information from the journal and set up the
 * journal structures in memory to ignore it (presumably because the
 * caller has evidence that it is out of date).
 * This function doesn&apos;t appear to be exported..

 * We perform one pass over the journal to allow us to tell the user how
 * much recovery information is being erased, and to let us initialise
 * the journal transaction sequence numbers to the next unused ID.
