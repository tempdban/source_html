 * While block_write_full_page is writing back the dirty buffers under
 * the page lock, whoever dirtied the buffers may decide to clean them
 * again at any time.  We handle that by only looking at the buffer
 * state inside lock_buffer().
 *
 * If block_write_full_page() is called for regular writeback
 * (wbc-&gt;sync_mode == WB_SYNC_NONE) then it will redirty a page which has a
 * locked buffer.   This only can happen if someone has written the buffer
 * directly, with submit_bh().  At the address_space level PageWriteback
 * prevents this contention from occurring.
 *
 * If block_write_full_page() is called with wbc-&gt;sync_mode ==
 * WB_SYNC_ALL, the writes are posted using REQ_SYNC; this
 * causes the writes to be flagged as synchronous writes.
