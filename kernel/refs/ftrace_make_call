 * ftrace_make_call - convert a nop call site into a call to addr
 * @rec: the mcount call site record
 * @addr: the address that the call site should call
 *
 * This is a very sensitive operation and great care needs
 * to be taken by the arch.  The operation should carefully
 * read the location, check to see if what is read is indeed
 * what we expect it to be, and then on success of the compare,
 * it should write to the location.
 *
 * The code segment at @rec-&gt;ip should be a nop
 *
 * Return must be:
 *  0 on success
 *  -EFAULT on error reading the location
 *  -EINVAL on a failed compare of the contents
 *  -EPERM  on error writing to the location
 * Any other value will be considered a failure.
