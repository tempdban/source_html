 * Specialize ZONE_DEVICE memory into multiple types each having differents
 * usage.
 *
 * MEMORY_DEVICE_PRIVATE:
 * Device memory that is not directly addressable by the CPU: CPU can neither
 * read nor write private memory. In this case, we do still have struct pages
 * backing the device memory. Doing so simplifies the implementation, but it is
 * important to remember that there are certain points at which the struct page
 * must be treated as an opaque object, rather than a &quot;normal&quot; struct page.
 *
 * A more complete discussion of unaddressable memory may be found in
 * include/linux/hmm.h and Documentation/vm/hmm.rst.
 *
 * MEMORY_DEVICE_PUBLIC:
 * Device memory that is cache coherent from device and CPU point of view. This
 * is use on platform that have an advance system bus (like CAPI or CCIX). A
 * driver can hotplug the device memory using ZONE_DEVICE and with that memory
 * type. Any page of a process can be migrated to such memory. However no one
 * should be allow to pin such memory so that it can always be evicted.
 *
 * MEMORY_DEVICE_FS_DAX:
 * Host memory that has similar access semantics as System RAM i.e. DMA
 * coherent and supports page pinning. In support of coordinating page
 * pinning vs other operations MEMORY_DEVICE_FS_DAX arranges for a
 * wakeup event whenever a page is unpinned and becomes idle. This
 * wakeup is used to coordinate physical address space management (ex:
 * fs truncate/hole punch) vs pinned pages (ex: device dma).
