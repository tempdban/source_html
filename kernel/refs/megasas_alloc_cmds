 * megasas_alloc_cmds -	Allocates the command packets
 * @instance:		Adapter soft state
 *
 * Each command that is issued to the FW, whether IO commands from the OS or
 * internal commands like IOCTLs, are wrapped in local data structure called
 * megasas_cmd. The frame embedded in this megasas_cmd is actually issued to
 * the FW.
 *
 * Each frame has a 32-bit field called context (tag). This context is used
 * to get back the megasas_cmd from the frame when a frame gets completed in
 * the ISR. Typically the address of the megasas_cmd itself would be used as
 * the context. But we wanted to keep the differences between 32 and 64 bit
 * systems to the mininum. We always use 32 bit integers for the context. In
 * this driver, the 32 bit values are the indices into an array cmd_list.
 * This array is used only to look up the megasas_cmd given the context. The
 * free commands themselves are maintained in a linked list called cmd_pool.
