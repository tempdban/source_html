 * Extract only the counts from the specified rcu_segcblist structure,
 * and place them in the specified rcu_cblist structure.  This function
 * supports both callback orphaning and invocation, hence the separation
 * of counts and callbacks.  (Callbacks ready for invocation must be
 * orphaned and adopted separately from pending callbacks, but counts
 * apply to all callbacks.  Locking must be used to make sure that
 * both orphaned-callbacks lists are consistent.)
