 * crypto_aead_decrypt() - decrypt ciphertext
 * @req: reference to the ablkcipher_request handle that holds all information
 *	 needed to perform the cipher operation
 *
 * Decrypt ciphertext data using the aead_request handle. That data structure
 * and how it is filled with data is discussed with the aead_request_*
 * functions.
 *
 * IMPORTANT NOTE The caller must concatenate the ciphertext followed by the
 *		  authentication data / tag. That authentication data / tag
 *		  must have the size defined by the crypto_aead_setauthsize
 *		  invocation.
 *
 *
 * Return: 0 if the cipher operation was successful; -EBADMSG: The AEAD
 *	   cipher operation performs the authentication of the data during the
 *	   decryption operation. Therefore, the function returns this error if
 *	   the authentication of the ciphertext was unsuccessful (i.e. the
 *	   integrity of the ciphertext or the associated data was violated);
 *	   &lt; 0 if an error occurred.
