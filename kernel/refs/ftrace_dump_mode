 * General tracing related utility functions - trace_printk(),
 * tracing_on/tracing_off and tracing_start()/tracing_stop
 *
 * Use tracing_on/tracing_off when you want to quickly turn on or off
 * tracing. It simply enables or disables the recording of the trace events.
 * This also corresponds to the user space /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/tracing_on
 * file, which gives a means for the kernel and userspace to interact.
 * Place a tracing_off() in the kernel where you want tracing to end.
 * From user space, examine the trace, and then echo 1 &gt; tracing_on
 * to continue tracing.
 *
 * tracing_stop/tracing_start has slightly more overhead. It is used
 * by things like suspend to ram where disabling the recording of the
 * trace is not enough, but tracing must actually stop because things
 * like calling smp_processor_id() may crash the system.
 *
 * Most likely, you want to use tracing_on/tracing_off.
