 * struct futex_q - The hashed futex queue entry, one per waiting task
 * @list:		priority-sorted list of tasks waiting on this futex
 * @task:		the task waiting on the futex
 * @lock_ptr:		the hash bucket lock
 * @key:		the key the futex is hashed on
 * @pi_state:		optional priority inheritance state
 * @rt_waiter:		rt_waiter storage for use with requeue_pi
 * @requeue_pi_key:	the requeue_pi target futex key
 * @bitset:		bitset for the optional bitmasked wakeup
 *
 * We use this hashed waitqueue, instead of a normal wait_queue_entry_t, so
 * we can wake only the relevant ones (hashed queues may be shared).
 *
 * A futex_q has a woken state, just like tasks have TASK_RUNNING.
 * It is considered woken when plist_node_empty(&amp;q-&gt;list) || q-&gt;lock_ptr == 0.
 * The order of wakeup is always to make the first condition true, then
 * the second.
 *
 * PI futexes are typically woken before they are removed from the hash list via
 * the rt_mutex code. See unqueue_me_pi().
