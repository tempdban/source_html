	 * TP_VLAN_PRI_MAP Compressed Filter Tuple field offsets.  This is a
	 * subset of the set of fields which may be present in the Compressed
	 * Filter Tuple portion of filters and TCP TCB connections.  The
	 * fields which are present are controlled by the TP_VLAN_PRI_MAP.
	 * Since a variable number of fields may or may not be present, their
	 * shifted field positions within the Compressed Filter Tuple may
	 * vary, or not even be present if the field isn&apos;t selected in
	 * TP_VLAN_PRI_MAP.  Since some of these fields are needed in various
	 * places we store their offsets here, or a -1 if the field isn&apos;t
	 * present.
