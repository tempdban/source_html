	 * If %false, this subsystem is properly hierarchical -
	 * configuration, resource accounting and restriction on a parent
	 * cgroup cover those of its children.  If %true, hierarchy support
	 * is broken in some ways - some subsystems ignore hierarchy
	 * completely while others are only implemented half-way.
	 *
	 * It&apos;s now disallowed to create nested cgroups if the subsystem is
	 * broken and cgroup core will emit a warning message on such
	 * cases.  Eventually, all subsystems will be made properly
	 * hierarchical and this will go away.
