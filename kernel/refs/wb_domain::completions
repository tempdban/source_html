	 * Scale the writeback cache size proportional to the relative
	 * writeout speed.
	 *
	 * We do this by keeping a floating proportion between BDIs, based
	 * on page writeback completions [end_page_writeback()]. Those
	 * devices that write out pages fastest will get the larger share,
	 * while the slower will get a smaller share.
	 *
	 * We use page writeout completions because we are interested in
	 * getting rid of dirty pages. Having them written out is the
	 * primary goal.
	 *
	 * We introduce a concept of time, a period over which we measure
	 * these events, because demand can/will vary over time. The length
	 * of this period itself is measured in page writeback completions.
