	 * @VMMDEVREQ_GET_DISPLAY_CHANGE_REQ2:
	 * Retrieve a display resize request sent by the host.
	 *
	 * Queries a display resize request sent from the host.  If the
	 * event_ack member is sent to true and there is an unqueried request
	 * available for one of the virtual display then that request will
	 * be returned.  If several displays have unqueried requests the lowest
	 * numbered display will be chosen first.  Only the most recent unseen
	 * request for each display is remembered.
	 * If event_ack is set to false, the last host request queried with
	 * event_ack set is resent, or failing that the most recent received
	 * from the host.  If no host request was ever received then all zeros
	 * are returned.
