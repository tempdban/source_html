 * memory pools need a pointer to the mddev, so they can force an unplug
 * when memory is tight, and a count of the number of drives that the
 * pool was allocated for, so they know how much to allocate and free.
 * mddev-&gt;raid_disks cannot be used, as it can change while a pool is active
 * These two datums are stored in a kmalloced struct.
 * The &apos;raid_disks&apos; here is twice the raid_disks in r1conf.
 * This allows space for each &apos;real&apos; device can have a replacement in the
 * second half of the array.
