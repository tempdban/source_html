 * The fileid_type identifies how the file within the filesystem is encoded.
 * In theory this is freely set and parsed by the filesystem, but we try to
 * stick to conventions so we can share some generic code and don&apos;t confuse
 * sniffers like ethereal/wireshark.
 *
 * The filesystem must not use the value &apos;0&apos; or &apos;0xff&apos;.
