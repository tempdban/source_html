 * This function is a &quot;CDC Ethernet Networking Control Model&quot; (CDC ECM)
 * Ethernet link.  The data transfer model is simple (packets sent and
 * received over bulk endpoints using normal short packet termination),
 * and the control model exposes various data and optional notifications.
 *
 * ECM is well standardized and (except for Microsoft) supported by most
 * operating systems with USB host support.  It&apos;s the preferred interop
 * solution for Ethernet over USB, at least for firmware based solutions.
 * (Hardware solutions tend to be more minimalist.)  A newer and simpler
 * &quot;Ethernet Emulation Model&quot; (CDC EEM) hasn&apos;t yet caught on.
 *
 * Note that ECM requires the use of &quot;alternate settings&quot; for its data
 * interface.  This means that the set_alt() method has real work to do,
 * and also means that a get_alt() method is required.
