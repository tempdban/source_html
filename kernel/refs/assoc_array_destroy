 * assoc_array_destroy - Destroy an associative array
 * @array: The array to destroy.
 * @ops: The operations to use.
 *
 * Discard all metadata and free all objects in an associative array.  The
 * array will be empty and ready to use again upon completion.  This function
 * cannot fail.
 *
 * The caller must prevent all other accesses whilst this takes place as no
 * attempt is made to adjust pointers gracefully to permit RCU readlock-holding
 * accesses to continue.  On the other hand, no memory allocation is required.
