 * FC SCSI Target Attributes
 *
 * The SCSI Target is considered an extension of a remote port (as
 * a remote port can be more than a SCSI Target). Within the scsi
 * subsystem, we leave the Target as a separate entity. Doing so
 * provides backward compatibility with prior FC transport api&apos;s,
 * and lets remote ports be handled entirely within the FC transport
 * and independently from the scsi subsystem. The drawback is that
 * some data will be duplicated.
