 * This function runs a service callback from a non-service lcore.
 *
 * This function is designed to enable gradual porting to service cores, and
 * to enable unit tests to verify a service behaves as expected.
 *
 * When called, this function ensures that the service identified by *id* is
 * safe to run on this lcore. Multi-thread safe services are invoked even if
 * other cores are simultaneously running them as they are multi-thread safe.
 *
 * Multi-thread unsafe services are handled depending on the variable
 * *serialize_multithread_unsafe*:
 * - When set, the function will check if a service is already being invoked
 *   on another lcore, refusing to run it and returning -EBUSY.
 * - When zero, the application takes responsibility to ensure that the service
 *   indicated by *id* is not going to be invoked by another lcore. This setting
 *   avoids atomic operations, so is likely to be more performant.
 *
 * @param id The ID of the service to run
 * @param serialize_multithread_unsafe This parameter indicates to the service
 *           cores library if it is required to use atomics to serialize access
 *           to mult-thread unsafe services. As there is an overhead in using
 *           atomics, applications can choose to enable or disable this feature
 *
 * Note that any thread calling this function MUST be a DPDK EAL thread, as
 * the *rte_lcore_id* function is used to access internal data structures.
 *
 * @retval 0 Service was run on the calling thread successfully
 * @retval -EBUSY Another lcore is executing the service, and it is not a
 *         multi-thread safe service, so the service was not run on this lcore
 * @retval -ENOEXEC Service is not in a run-able state
 * @retval -EINVAL Invalid service id
