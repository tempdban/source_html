 * aa_dfa_match_until - traverse @dfa until accept state or end of input
 * @dfa: the dfa to match @str against  (NOT NULL)
 * @start: the state of the dfa to start matching in
 * @str: the null terminated string of bytes to match against the dfa (NOT NULL)
 * @retpos: first character in str after match OR end of string
 *
 * aa_dfa_match will match @str against the dfa and return the state it
 * finished matching in. The final state can be used to look up the accepting
 * label, or as the start state of a continuing match.
 *
 * Returns: final state reached after input is consumed
