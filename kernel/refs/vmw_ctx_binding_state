 * struct vmw_ctx_binding_state - per context binding state
 *
 * @dev_priv: Pointer to device private structure.
 * @list: linked list of individual active bindings.
 * @render_targets: Render target bindings.
 * @texture_units: Texture units bindings.
 * @ds_view: Depth-stencil view binding.
 * @so_targets: StreamOutput target bindings.
 * @vertex_buffers: Vertex buffer bindings.
 * @index_buffer: Index buffer binding.
 * @per_shader: Per shader-type bindings.
 * @dirty: Bitmap tracking per binding-type changes that have not yet
 * been emitted to the device.
 * @dirty_vb: Bitmap tracking individual vertex buffer binding changes that
 * have not yet been emitted to the device.
 * @bind_cmd_buffer: Scratch space used to construct binding commands.
 * @bind_cmd_count: Number of binding command data entries in @bind_cmd_buffer
 * @bind_first_slot: Used together with @bind_cmd_buffer to indicate the
 * device binding slot of the first command data entry in @bind_cmd_buffer.
 *
 * Note that this structure also provides storage space for the individual
 * struct vmw_ctx_binding objects, so that no dynamic allocation is needed
 * for individual bindings.
