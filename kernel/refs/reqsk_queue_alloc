 * Maximum number of SYN_RECV sockets in queue per LISTEN socket.
 * One SYN_RECV socket costs about 80bytes on a 32bit machine.
 * It would be better to replace it with a global counter for all sockets
 * but then some measure against one socket starving all other sockets
 * would be needed.
 *
 * The minimum value of it is 128. Experiments with real servers show that
 * it is absolutely not enough even at 100conn/sec. 256 cures most
 * of problems.
 * This value is adjusted to 128 for low memory machines,
 * and it will increase in proportion to the memory of machine.
 * Note : Dont forget somaxconn that may limit backlog too.
