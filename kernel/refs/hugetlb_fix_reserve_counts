 * A rare out of memory error was encountered which prevented removal of
 * the reserve map region for a page.  The huge page itself was free&apos;ed
 * and removed from the page cache.  This routine will adjust the subpool
 * usage count, and the global reserve count if needed.  By incrementing
 * these counts, the reserve map entry which could not be deleted will
 * appear as a &quot;reserved&quot; entry instead of simply dangling with incorrect
 * counts.
