 *
 * o SCTP endpoint: The logical sender/receiver of SCTP packets. On a
 *   multi-homed host, an SCTP endpoint is represented to its peers as a
 *   combination of a set of eligible destination transport addresses to
 *   which SCTP packets can be sent and a set of eligible source
 *   transport addresses from which SCTP packets can be received.
 *   All transport addresses used by an SCTP endpoint must use the
 *   same port number, but can use multiple IP addresses. A transport
 *   address used by an SCTP endpoint must not be used by another
 *   SCTP endpoint. In other words, a transport address is unique
 *   to an SCTP endpoint.
 *
 * From an implementation perspective, each socket has one of these.
 * A TCP-style socket will have exactly one association on one of
 * these.  An UDP-style socket will have multiple associations hanging
 * off one of these.
