 * RCU global state, including node hierarchy.  This hierarchy is
 * represented in &quot;heap&quot; form in a dense array.  The root (first level)
 * of the hierarchy is in -&gt;node[0] (referenced by -&gt;level[0]), the second
 * level in -&gt;node[1] through -&gt;node[m] (-&gt;node[1] referenced by -&gt;level[1]),
 * and the third level in -&gt;node[m+1] and following (-&gt;node[m+1] referenced
 * by -&gt;level[2]).  The number of levels is determined by the number of
 * CPUs and by CONFIG_RCU_FANOUT.  Small systems will have a &quot;hierarchy&quot;
 * consisting of a single rcu_node.
