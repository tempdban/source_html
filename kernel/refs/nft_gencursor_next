 * The gencursor defines two generations, the currently active and the
 * next one. Objects contain a bitmask of 2 bits specifying the generations
 * they&apos;re active in. A set bit means they&apos;re inactive in the generation
 * represented by that bit.
 *
 * New objects start out as inactive in the current and active in the
 * next generation. When committing the ruleset the bitmask is cleared,
 * meaning they&apos;re active in all generations. When removing an object,
 * it is set inactive in the next generation. After committing the ruleset,
 * the objects are removed.
