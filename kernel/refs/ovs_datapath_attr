 * enum ovs_datapath_attr - attributes for %OVS_DP_* commands.
 * @OVS_DP_ATTR_NAME: Name of the network device that serves as the &quot;local
 * port&quot;.  This is the name of the network device whose dp_ifindex is given in
 * the &amp;struct ovs_header.  Always present in notifications.  Required in
 * %OVS_DP_NEW requests.  May be used as an alternative to specifying
 * dp_ifindex in other requests (with a dp_ifindex of 0).
 * @OVS_DP_ATTR_UPCALL_PID: The Netlink socket in userspace that is initially
 * set on the datapath port (for OVS_ACTION_ATTR_MISS).  Only valid on
 * %OVS_DP_CMD_NEW requests. A value of zero indicates that upcalls should
 * not be sent.
 * @OVS_DP_ATTR_STATS: Statistics about packets that have passed through the
 * datapath.  Always present in notifications.
 * @OVS_DP_ATTR_MEGAFLOW_STATS: Statistics about mega flow masks usage for the
 * datapath. Always present in notifications.
 *
 * These attributes follow the &amp;struct ovs_header within the Generic Netlink
 * payload for %OVS_DP_* commands.
