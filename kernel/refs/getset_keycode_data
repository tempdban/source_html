 * Translation of scancodes to keycodes. We set them on only the first
 * keyboard in the list that accepts the scancode and keycode.
 * Explanation for not choosing the first attached keyboard anymore:
 *  USB keyboards for example have two event devices: one for all &quot;normal&quot;
 *  keys and one for extra function keys (like &quot;volume up&quot;, &quot;make coffee&quot;,
 *  etc.). So this means that scancodes for the extra function keys won&apos;t
 *  be valid for the first event device, but will be for the second.
