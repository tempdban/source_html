 * struct regulator_state - regulator state during low power system states
 *
 * This describes a regulators state during a system wide low power
 * state.  One of enabled or disabled must be set for the
 * configuration to be applied.
 *
 * @uV: Default operating voltage during suspend, it can be adjusted
 *	among &lt;min_uV, max_uV&gt;.
 * @min_uV: Minimum suspend voltage may be set.
 * @max_uV: Maximum suspend voltage may be set.
 * @mode: Operating mode during suspend.
 * @enabled: operations during suspend.
 *	     - DO_NOTHING_IN_SUSPEND
 *	     - DISABLE_IN_SUSPEND
 *	     - ENABLE_IN_SUSPEND
 * @changeable: Is this state can be switched between enabled/disabled,
