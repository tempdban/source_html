 * This function validates the new parameters of a -deadline task.
 * We ask for the deadline not being zero, and greater or equal
 * than the runtime, as well as the period of being zero or
 * greater than deadline. Furthermore, we have to be sure that
 * user parameters are above the internal resolution of 1us (we
 * check sched_runtime only since it is always the smaller one) and
 * below 2^63 ns (we have to check both sched_deadline and
 * sched_period, as the latter can be zero).
