   Decode literal, length, and distance codes and write out the resulting
   literal and match bytes until either not enough input or output is
   available, an end-of-block is encountered, or a data error is encountered.
   When large enough input and output buffers are supplied to inflate(), for
   example, a 16K input buffer and a 64K output buffer, more than 95% of the
   inflate execution time is spent in this routine.

   Entry assumptions:

        state-&gt;mode == LEN
        strm-&gt;avail_in &gt;= 6
        strm-&gt;avail_out &gt;= 258
        start &gt;= strm-&gt;avail_out
        state-&gt;bits &lt; 8

   On return, state-&gt;mode is one of:

        LEN -- ran out of enough output space or enough available input
        TYPE -- reached end of block code, inflate() to interpret next block
        BAD -- error in block data

   Notes:

    - The maximum input bits used by a length/distance pair is 15 bits for the
      length code, 5 bits for the length extra, 15 bits for the distance code,
      and 13 bits for the distance extra.  This totals 48 bits, or six bytes.
      Therefore if strm-&gt;avail_in &gt;= 6, then there is enough input to avoid
      checking for available input while decoding.

    - The maximum bytes that a single length/distance pair can output is 258
      bytes, which is the maximum length that can be coded.  inflate_fast()
      requires strm-&gt;avail_out &gt;= 258 for each loop to avoid checking for
      output space.

    - @start:	inflate()&apos;s starting value for strm-&gt;avail_out
