 * ttm_lock_set_kill
 *
 * @lock: Pointer to a struct ttm_lock
 * @val: Boolean whether to kill processes taking the lock.
 * @signal: Signal to send to the process taking the lock.
 *
 * The kill-when-taking-lock functionality is used to kill processes that keep
 * on using the TTM functionality when its resources has been taken down, for
 * example when the X server exits. A typical sequence would look like this:
 * - X server takes lock in write mode.
 * - ttm_lock_set_kill() is called with @val set to true.
 * - As part of X server exit, TTM resources are taken down.
 * - X server releases the lock on file release.
 * - Another dri client wants to render, takes the lock and is killed.
