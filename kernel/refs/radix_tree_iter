 * struct radix_tree_iter - radix tree iterator state
 *
 * @index:	index of current slot
 * @next_index:	one beyond the last index for this chunk
 * @tags:	bit-mask for tag-iterating
 * @node:	node that contains current slot
 * @shift:	shift for the node that holds our slots
 *
 * This radix tree iterator works in terms of &quot;chunks&quot; of slots.  A chunk is a
 * subinterval of slots contained within one radix tree leaf node.  It is
 * described by a pointer to its first slot and a struct radix_tree_iter
 * which holds the chunk&apos;s position in the tree and its size.  For tagged
 * iteration radix_tree_iter also holds the slots&apos; bit-mask for one chosen
 * radix tree tag.
