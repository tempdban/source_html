 * @pf: Board private structure

 * Respond to the user filter requests and make the appropriate hardware
 * changes here. The XL710 cannot support splitting of the Tx/Rx timestamping
 * logic, so keep track in software of whether to indicate these timestamps
 * or not.

 * It is permissible to &quot;upgrade&quot; the user request to a broader filter, as long
 * as the user receives the timestamps they care about and the user is notified
 * the filter has been broadened.
