 * If a volume has been upgraded from a previous NTFS version, then these
 * fields are present only if the file has been accessed since the upgrade.
 * Recognize the difference by comparing the length of the resident attribute
 * value. If it is 48, then the following fields are missing. If it is 72 then
 * the fields are present. Maybe just check like this:
 *	if (resident.ValueLength &lt; sizeof(STANDARD_INFORMATION)) {
 *		Assume NTFS 1.2- format.
 *		If (volume version is 3.x)
 *			Upgrade attribute to NTFS 3.x format.
 *		else
 *			Use NTFS 1.2- format for access.
 *	} else
 *		Use NTFS 3.x format for access.
 * Only problem is that it might be legal to set the length of the value to
 * arbitrarily large values thus spoiling this check. - But chkdsk probably
 * views that as a corruption, assuming that it behaves like this for all
 * attributes.
