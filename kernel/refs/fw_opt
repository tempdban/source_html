 * enum fw_opt - options to control firmware loading behaviour
 *
 * @FW_OPT_UEVENT: Enables the fallback mechanism to send a kobject uevent
 *	when the firmware is not found. Userspace is in charge to load the
 *	firmware using the sysfs loading facility.
 * @FW_OPT_NOWAIT: Used to describe the firmware request is asynchronous.
 * @FW_OPT_USERHELPER: Enable the fallback mechanism, in case the direct
 *	filesystem lookup fails at finding the firmware.  For details refer to
 *	firmware_fallback_sysfs().
 * @FW_OPT_NO_WARN: Quiet, avoid printing warning messages.
 * @FW_OPT_NOCACHE: Disables firmware caching. Firmware caching is used to
 *	cache the firmware upon suspend, so that upon resume races against the
 *	firmware file lookup on storage is avoided. Used for calls where the
 *	file may be too big, or where the driver takes charge of its own
 *	firmware caching mechanism.
 * @FW_OPT_NOFALLBACK: Disable the fallback mechanism. Takes precedence over
 *	&amp;FW_OPT_UEVENT and &amp;FW_OPT_USERHELPER.
