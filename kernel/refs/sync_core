 * This function forces the icache and prefetched instruction stream to
 * catch up with reality in two very specific cases:
 *
 *  a) Text was modified using one virtual address and is about to be executed
 *     from the same physical page at a different virtual address.
 *
 *  b) Text was modified on a different CPU, may subsequently be
 *     executed on this CPU, and you want to make sure the new version
 *     gets executed.  This generally means you&apos;re calling this in a IPI.
 *
 * If you&apos;re calling this for a different reason, you&apos;re probably doing
 * it wrong.
