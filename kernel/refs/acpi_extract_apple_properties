 * @adev: ACPI device for which to retrieve the properties

 * Invoke Apple&apos;s custom _DSM once to check the protocol version and once more
 * to retrieve the properties.  They are marshalled up in a single package as
 * alternating key/value elements, unlike _DSD which stores them as a package
 * of 2-element packages.  Convert to _DSD format and make them available under
 * the primary fwnode.
