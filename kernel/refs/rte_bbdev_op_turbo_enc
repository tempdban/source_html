<doc f='linux-4.18.y/lib/librte_bbdev/rte_bbdev_op.h' l='345'>/**&lt; Operation structure for Turbo encode.
 * An operation can perform on one CB at a time &quot;CB-mode&quot;.
 * An operation can perform on one or multiple CBs that are logically
 * belonging to one TB &quot;TB-mode&quot;.
 *
 * In CB-mode, CRC24A/B is an optional operation. K size parameter is not
 * affected by CRC24A/B inclusion, this only affects the inbound mbuf data
 * length. Not all BBDEV PMDs are capable of CRC24A/B calculation. Flags
 * RTE_BBDEV_TURBO_CRC_24A_ATTACH and RTE_BBDEV_TURBO_CRC_24B_ATTACH informs
 * the application with relevant capability. These flags can be set in the
 * op_flags parameter to indicate BBDEV to calculate and append CRC24A to CB
 * before going forward with Turbo encoding.
 *
 * In TB-mode, CRC24A is assumed to be pre-calculated and appended to the
 * inbound TB mbuf data buffer.
 *
 * The output mbuf data structure is expected to be allocated by the
 * application with enough room for the output data.
