 * Each physical page in the system has a struct page associated with
 * it to keep track of whatever it is we are using the page for at the
 * moment. Note that we have no way to track which tasks are using
 * a page, though if it is a pagecache page, rmap structures can tell us
 * who is mapping it.
 *
 * The objects in struct page are organized in double word blocks in
 * order to allows us to use atomic double word operations on portions
 * of struct page. That is currently only used by slub but the arrangement
 * allows the use of atomic double word operations on the flags/mapping
 * and lru list pointers also.
