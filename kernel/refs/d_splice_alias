 * d_splice_alias - splice a disconnected dentry into the tree if one exists
 * @inode:  the inode which may have a disconnected dentry
 * @dentry: a negative dentry which we want to point to the inode.
 *
 * If inode is a directory and has an IS_ROOT alias, then d_move that in
 * place of the given dentry and return it, else simply d_add the inode
 * to the dentry and return NULL.
 *
 * If a non-IS_ROOT directory is found, the filesystem is corrupt, and
 * we should error out: directories can&apos;t have multiple aliases.
 *
 * This is needed in the lookup routine of any filesystem that is exportable
 * (via knfsd) so that we can build dcache paths to directories effectively.
 *
 * If a dentry was found and moved, then it is returned.  Otherwise NULL
 * is returned.  This matches the expected return value of -&gt;lookup.
 *
 * Cluster filesystems may call this function with a negative, hashed dentry.
 * In that case, we know that the inode will be a regular file, and also this
 * will only occur during atomic_open. So we need to check for the dentry
 * being already hashed only in the final case.
