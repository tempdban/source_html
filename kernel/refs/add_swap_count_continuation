 * page of the original vmalloc&apos;ed swap_map, to hold the continuation count
 * (for that entry and for its neighbouring PAGE_SIZE swap entries).  Called
 * again when count is duplicated beyond SWAP_MAP_MAX * SWAP_CONT_MAX, etc.
 *
 * These continuation pages are seldom referenced: the common paths all work
 * on the original swap_map, only referring to a continuation page when the
 * low &quot;digit&quot; of a count is incremented or decremented through SWAP_MAP_MAX.
 *
 * add_swap_count_continuation(, GFP_ATOMIC) can be called while holding
 * page table locks; if it fails, add_swap_count_continuation(, GFP_KERNEL)
 * can be called after dropping locks.
