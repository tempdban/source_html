 * Get offset into segment file descriptor associated with a particular memseg
 * (if available).
 *
 * @note This function read-locks the memory hotplug subsystem, and thus cannot
 *       be used within memory-related callback functions.
 *
 * @param ms
 *   A pointer to memseg for which to get file descriptor.
 * @param offset
 *   A pointer to offset value where the result will be stored.
 *
 * @return
 *   Valid file descriptor in case of success.
 *   -1 in case of error, with ``rte_errno`` set to the following values:
 *     - EINVAL  - ``ms`` pointer was NULL or did not point to a valid memseg
 *     - EINVAL  - ``offset`` pointer was NULL
 *     - ENODEV  - ``ms`` fd is not available
 *     - ENOENT  - ``ms`` is an unused segment
 *     - ENOTSUP - segment fd&apos;s are not supported
