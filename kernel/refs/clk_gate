 * @hw:		handle between common and hardware-specific interfaces

 * @flags:	hardware-specific flags
 * @lock:	register lock
 *
 * Clock which can gate its output.  Implements .enable &amp; .disable
 *
 * Flags:
 * CLK_GATE_SET_TO_DISABLE - by default this clock sets the bit at bit_idx to
 *	enable the clock.  Setting this flag does the opposite: setting the bit
 *	disable the clock and clearing it enables the clock
 * CLK_GATE_HIWORD_MASK - The gate settings are only in lower 16-bit
 *	of this register, and mask of gate bits are in higher 16-bit of this
 *	register.  While setting the gate bits, higher 16-bit should also be
 *	updated to indicate changing gate bits.
