 * __drm_atomic_get_current_plane_state - get current plane state
 * @state: global atomic state object
 * @plane: plane to grab
 *
 * This function returns the plane state for the given plane, either from
 * @state, or if the plane isn&apos;t part of the atomic state update, from @plane.
 * This is useful in atomic check callbacks, when drivers need to peek at, but
 * not change, state of other planes, since it avoids threading an error code
 * back up the call chain.
 *
 * WARNING:
 *
 * Note that this function is in general unsafe since it doesn&apos;t check for the
 * required locking for access state structures. Drivers must ensure that it is
 * safe to access the returned state structure through other means. One common
 * example is when planes are fixed to a single CRTC, and the driver knows that
 * the CRTC lock is held already. In that case holding the CRTC lock gives a
 * read-lock on all planes connected to that CRTC. But if planes can be
 * reassigned things get more tricky. In that case it&apos;s better to use
 * drm_atomic_get_plane_state and wire up full error handling.
 *
 * Returns:
 *
 * Read-only pointer to the current plane state.
