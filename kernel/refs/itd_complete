 * Note that we carefully avoid recycling this descriptor until after any
 * completion callback runs, so that it won&apos;t be reused quickly.  That is,
 * assuming (a) no more than two urbs per frame on this endpoint, and also
 * (b) only this endpoint&apos;s completions submit URBs.  It seems some silicon
 * corrupts things if you reuse completed descriptors very quickly...
