 * kgdb_nmi_poll_knock - Check if it is time to enter the debugger
 *
 * &quot;Serial ports are often noisy, especially when muxed over another port (we
 * often use serial over the headset connector). Noise on the async command
 * line just causes characters that are ignored, on a command line that blocked
 * execution noise would be catastrophic.&quot; -- Colin Cross
 *
 * So, this function implements KGDB/KDB knocking on the serial line: we won&apos;t
 * enter the debugger until we receive a known magic phrase (which is actually
 * &quot;$3#33&quot;, known as &quot;escape to KDB&quot; command. There is also a relaxed variant
 * of knocking, i.e. just pressing the return key is enough to enter the
 * debugger. And if knocking is disabled, the function always returns 1.
