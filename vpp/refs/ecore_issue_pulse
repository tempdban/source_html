 * @brief When MFW doesn&apos;t get driver pulse for couple of seconds, at some
 * threshold before timeout expires, it will generate interrupt
 * through a dedicated status block (DPSB - Driver Pulse Status
 * Block), which the driver should respond immediately, by
 * providing keepalive indication after setting the PTT to the
 * driver-MFW mailbox. This function is called directly from the
 * DPC upon receiving the DPSB attention.
 *
 * @param p_hwfn - hw function
 * @param p_ptt - PTT required for register access
 * @return enum _ecore_status_t - ECORE_SUCCESS - operation
 * was successful.
