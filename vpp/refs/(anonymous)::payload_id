   * This value represents an application (or upper layer) specified protocol
   * identifier. This value is passed to SCTP by its upper layer and sent to its
   * peer. This identifier is not used by SCTP but can be used by certain network
   * entities, as well as by the peer application, to identify the type of
   * information being carried in this DATA chunk. This field must be sent even
   * in fragmented DATA chunks (to make sure it is available for agents in the
   * middle of the network).  Note that this field is NOT touched by an SCTP
   * implementation; therefore, its byte order is NOT necessarily big endian.
   * The upper layer is responsible for any byte order conversions to this field.
   * The value 0 indicates that no application identifier is specified by the
   * upper layer for this payload data.
