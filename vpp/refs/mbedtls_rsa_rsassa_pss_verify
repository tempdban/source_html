 * \brief          This function performs a PKCS#1 v2.1 PSS verification
 *                 operation (RSASSA-PSS-VERIFY).
 *
 *                 The hash function for the MGF mask generating function
 *                 is that specified in the RSA context.
 *
 * \param ctx      The RSA public key context.
 * \param f_rng    The RNG function. Only needed for #MBEDTLS_RSA_PRIVATE.
 * \param p_rng    The RNG parameter.
 * \param mode     #MBEDTLS_RSA_PUBLIC or #MBEDTLS_RSA_PRIVATE.
 * \param md_alg   The message-digest algorithm used to hash the original data.
 *                 Use #MBEDTLS_MD_NONE for signing raw data.
 * \param hashlen  The length of the message digest. Only used if \p md_alg is #MBEDTLS_MD_NONE.
 * \param hash     The buffer holding the message digest.
 * \param sig      The buffer holding the ciphertext.
 *
 * \deprecated     It is deprecated and discouraged to call this function
 *                 in #MBEDTLS_RSA_PRIVATE mode. Future versions of the library
 *                 are likely to remove the \p mode argument and have it
 *                 implicitly set to #MBEDTLS_RSA_PUBLIC.
 *
 * \note           Alternative implementations of RSA need not support
 *                 mode being set to #MBEDTLS_RSA_PRIVATE and might instead
 *                 return #MBEDTLS_ERR_RSA_UNSUPPORTED_OPERATION.
 *
 * \return         \c 0 if the verify operation was successful,
 *                 or an \c MBEDTLS_ERR_RSA_XXX error code
 *                 on failure.
 *
 * \note           The \p sig buffer must be as large as the size
 *                 of \p ctx-&gt;N. For example, 128 Bytes if RSA-1024 is used.
 *
 * \note           The \p hash_id in the RSA context is the one used for the
 *                 verification. \p md_alg in the function call is the type of
 *                 hash that is verified. According to &lt;em&gt;RFC-3447: Public-Key
 *                 Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #1 v2.1: RSA Cryptography
 *                 Specifications&lt;/em&gt; it is advised to keep both hashes the
 *                 same. If \p hash_id in the RSA context is unset,
 *                 the \p md_alg from the function call is used.
