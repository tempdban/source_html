 * Check the status of a Tx descriptor in the queue.
 *
 * It should be called in a similar context than the Tx function:
 * - on a dataplane core
 * - not concurrently on the same queue
 *
 * Since it&apos;s a dataplane function, no check is performed on port_id and
 * queue_id. The caller must therefore ensure that the port is enabled
 * and the queue is configured and running.
 *
 * Note: accessing to a random descriptor in the ring may trigger cache
 * misses and have a performance impact.
 *
 * @param port_id
 *  A valid port identifier of the Ethernet device which.
 * @param queue_id
 *  A valid Tx queue identifier on this port.
 * @param offset
 *  The offset of the descriptor starting from tail (0 is the place where
 *  the next packet will be send).
 *
 * @return
 *  - (RTE_ETH_TX_DESC_FULL) Descriptor is being processed by the hw, i.e.
 *    in the transmit queue.
 *  - (RTE_ETH_TX_DESC_DONE) Hardware is done with this descriptor, it can
 *    be reused by the driver.
 *  - (RTE_ETH_TX_DESC_UNAVAIL): Descriptor is unavailable, reserved by the
 *    driver or the hardware.
 *  - (-EINVAL) bad descriptor offset.
 *  - (-ENOTSUP) if the device does not support this function.
 *  - (-ENODEV) bad port or queue (only if compiled with debug).
