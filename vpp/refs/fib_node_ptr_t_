 * A representation of one pointer to another node.
 * To fully qualify a node, one must know its type and its index so it
 * can be retrieved from the appropriate pool. Direct pointers to nodes
 * are forbidden, since all nodes are allocated from pools, which are vectors,
 * and thus subject to realloc at any time.
