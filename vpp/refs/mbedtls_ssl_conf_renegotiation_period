 * \brief          Set record counter threshold for periodic renegotiation.
 *                 (Default: 2^48 - 1)
 *
 *                 Renegotiation is automatically triggered when a record
 *                 counter (outgoing or ingoing) crosses the defined
 *                 threshold. The default value is meant to prevent the
 *                 connection from being closed when the counter is about to
 *                 reached its maximal value (it is not allowed to wrap).
 *
 *                 Lower values can be used to enforce policies such as &quot;keys
 *                 must be refreshed every N packets with cipher X&quot;.
 *
 *                 The renegotiation period can be disabled by setting
 *                 conf-&gt;disable_renegotiation to
 *                 MBEDTLS_SSL_RENEGOTIATION_DISABLED.
 *
 * \note           When the configured transport is
 *                 MBEDTLS_SSL_TRANSPORT_DATAGRAM the maximum renegotiation
 *                 period is 2^48 - 1, and for MBEDTLS_SSL_TRANSPORT_STREAM,
 *                 the maximum renegotiation period is 2^64 - 1.
 *
 * \param conf     SSL configuration
 * \param period   The threshold value: a big-endian 64-bit number.
