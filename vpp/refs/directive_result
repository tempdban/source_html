 * What to return from a directive- or pragma-handling function.
 * Currently DIRR_OK and DIRR_ERROR are treated the same way;
 * in both cases the backend is expected to produce the appropriate
 * error message on its own.
 *
 * DIRR_BADPARAM causes a generic error message to be printed.  Note
 * that it is an error, not a warning, even in the case of pragmas;
 * don&apos;t use it where forward compatiblity would be compromised
 * (instead consider adding a DIRR_WARNPARAM.)
