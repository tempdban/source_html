 * \brief           Register callbacks for DTLS cookies
 *                  (Server only. DTLS only.)
 *
 *                  Default: dummy callbacks that fail, in order to force you to
 *                  register working callbacks (and initialize their context).
 *
 *                  To disable HelloVerifyRequest, register NULL callbacks.
 *
 * \warning         Disabling hello verification allows your server to be used
 *                  for amplification in DoS attacks against other hosts.
 *                  Only disable if you known this can&apos;t happen in your
 *                  particular environment.
 *
 * \note            See comments on \c mbedtls_ssl_handshake() about handling
 *                  the MBEDTLS_ERR_SSL_HELLO_VERIFY_REQUIRED that is expected
 *                  on the first handshake attempt when this is enabled.
 *
 * \note            This is also necessary to handle client reconnection from
 *                  the same port as described in RFC 6347 section 4.2.8 (only
 *                  the variant with cookies is supported currently). See
 *                  comments on \c mbedtls_ssl_read() for details.
 *
 * \param conf              SSL configuration
 * \param f_cookie_write    Cookie write callback
 * \param f_cookie_check    Cookie check callback
 * \param p_cookie          Context for both callbacks
