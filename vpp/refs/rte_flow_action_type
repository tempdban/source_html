 * Action types.
 *
 * Each possible action is represented by a type. Some have associated
 * configuration structures. Several actions combined in a list can be
 * affected to a flow rule. That list is not ordered.
 *
 * They fall in three categories:
 *
 * - Terminating actions (such as QUEUE, DROP, RSS, PF, VF) that prevent
 *   processing matched packets by subsequent flow rules, unless overridden
 *   with PASSTHRU.
 *
 * - Non terminating actions (PASSTHRU, DUP) that leave matched packets up
 *   for additional processing by subsequent flow rules.
 *
 * - Other non terminating meta actions that do not affect the fate of
 *   packets (END, VOID, MARK, FLAG, COUNT).
 *
 * When several actions are combined in a flow rule, they should all have
 * different types (e.g. dropping a packet twice is not possible).
 *
 * Only the last action of a given type is taken into account. PMDs still
 * perform error checking on the entire list.
 *
 * Note that PASSTHRU is the only action able to override a terminating
 * rule.
