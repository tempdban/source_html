 * \brief           This function clears the internal structure of \p ctx and
 *                  frees any embedded internal structure, but does not free
 *                  \p ctx itself.
 *
 *                  If you have called mbedtls_md_setup() on \p ctx, you must
 *                  call mbedtls_md_free() when you are no longer using the
 *                  context.
 *                  Calling this function if you have previously
 *                  called mbedtls_md_init() and nothing else is optional.
 *                  You must not call this function if you have not called
 *                  mbedtls_md_init().
