 * \brief          This function performs an RSA private key operation.
 *
 * \param ctx      The RSA context.
 * \param f_rng    The RNG function. Needed for blinding.
 * \param p_rng    The RNG parameter.
 * \param input    The input buffer.
 * \param output   The output buffer.
 *
 * \return         \c 0 on success, or an \c MBEDTLS_ERR_RSA_XXX error code
 *                 on failure.
 *
 * \note           The input and output buffers must be large
 *                 enough. For example, 128 Bytes if RSA-1024 is used.
 *
 * \note           Blinding is used if and only if a PRNG is provided.
 *
 * \note           If blinding is used, both the base of exponentation
 *                 and the exponent are blinded, providing protection
 *                 against some side-channel attacks.
 *
 * \warning        It is deprecated and a security risk to not provide
 *                 a PRNG here and thereby prevent the use of blinding.
 *                 Future versions of the library may enforce the presence
 *                 of a PRNG.
