The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) Data Link Layer [146,147,175]
contains a 16 bit Protocol field to identify the the encapsulated
protocol.  The Protocol field is consistent with the ISO 3309 (HDLC)
extension mechanism for Address fields.  All Protocols MUST be
assigned such that the least significant bit of the most significant
octet equals &quot;0&quot;, and the least significant bit of the least
significant octet equals &quot;1&quot;.
