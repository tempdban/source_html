	 * When set to 1, the advertisement of pause is enabled. # When
	 * the auto_mode is not set to none and this flag is set to 1,
	 * then the auto_pause bits on this port are being advertised
	 * and autoneg pause results are being interpreted. # When the
	 * auto_mode is not set to none and this flag is set to 0, the
	 * pause is forced as indicated in force_pause, and also
	 * advertised as auto_pause bits, but the autoneg results are
	 * not interpreted since the pause configuration is being
	 * forced. # When the auto_mode is set to none and this flag is
	 * set to 1, auto_pause bits should be ignored and should be set
	 * to 0.
