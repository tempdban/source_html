 * \def MBEDTLS_PK_PARSE_EC_EXTENDED
 *
 * Enhance support for reading EC keys using variants of SEC1 not allowed by
 * RFC 5915 and RFC 5480.
 *
 * Currently this means parsing the SpecifiedECDomain choice of EC
 * parameters (only known groups are supported, not arbitrary domains, to
 * avoid validation issues).
 *
 * Disable if you only need to support RFC 5915 + 5480 key formats.
