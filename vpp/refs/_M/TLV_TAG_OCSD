 *
 * This setting allows OCSD to be disabled. This is a requirement for HP
 * servers to support PCI passthrough for virtualization.
 *
 * The DEFAULT mode (which is the same as the tag not being present) is
 * equivalent to ENABLED.
 *
 * This option is not used by the MCFW, and is entirely handled by the various
 * drivers that support OCSD, by reading the setting before they attempt
 * to enable OCSD.
