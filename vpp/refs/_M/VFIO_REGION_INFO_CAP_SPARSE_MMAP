 * The sparse mmap capability allows finer granularity of specifying areas
 * within a region with mmap support.  When specified, the user should only
 * mmap the offset ranges specified by the areas array.  mmaps outside of the
 * areas specified may fail (such as the range covering a PCI MSI-X table) or
 * may result in improper device behavior.
 *
 * The structures below define version 1 of this capability.
