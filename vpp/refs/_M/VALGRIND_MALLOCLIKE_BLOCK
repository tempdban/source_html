   when heap blocks are allocated in order to give accurate results.  This
   happens automatically for the standard allocator functions such as
   malloc(), calloc(), realloc(), memalign(), new, new[], free(), delete,
   delete[], etc.

   But if your program uses a custom allocator, this doesn&apos;t automatically
   happen, and Valgrind will not do as well.  For example, if you allocate
   superblocks with mmap() and then allocates chunks of the superblocks, all
   Valgrind&apos;s observations will be at the mmap() level and it won&apos;t know that
   the chunks should be considered separate entities.  In Memcheck&apos;s case,
   that means you probably won&apos;t get heap block overrun detection (because
   there won&apos;t be redzones marked as unaddressable) and you definitely won&apos;t
   get any leak detection.

   The following client requests allow a custom allocator to be annotated so
   that it can be handled accurately by Valgrind.

   VALGRIND_MALLOCLIKE_BLOCK marks a region of memory as having been allocated
   by a malloc()-like function.  For Memcheck (an illustrative case), this
   does two things:

   - It records that the block has been allocated.  This means any addresses
     within the block mentioned in error messages will be
     identified as belonging to the block.  It also means that if the block
     isn&apos;t freed it will be detected by the leak checker.

   - It marks the block as being addressable and undefined (if &apos;is_zeroed&apos; is
     not set), or addressable and defined (if &apos;is_zeroed&apos; is set).  This
     controls how accesses to the block by the program are handled.

   &apos;addr&apos; is the start of the usable block (ie. after any
   redzone), &apos;sizeB&apos; is its size.  &apos;rzB&apos; is the redzone size if the allocator
   can apply redzones -- these are blocks of padding at the start and end of
   each block.  Adding redzones is recommended as it makes it much more likely
   Valgrind will spot block overruns.  `is_zeroed&apos; indicates if the memory is
   zeroed (or filled with another predictable value), as is the case for
   calloc().

   VALGRIND_MALLOCLIKE_BLOCK should be put immediately after the point where a
   heap block -- that will be used by the client program -- is allocated.
   It&apos;s best to put it at the outermost level of the allocator if possible;
   for example, if you have a function my_alloc() which calls
   internal_alloc(), and the client request is put inside internal_alloc(),
   stack traces relating to the heap block will contain entries for both
   my_alloc() and internal_alloc(), which is probably not what you want.

   For Memcheck users: if you use VALGRIND_MALLOCLIKE_BLOCK to carve out
   custom blocks from within a heap block, B, that has been allocated with
   malloc/calloc/new/etc, then block B will be *ignored* during leak-checking
   -- the custom blocks will take precedence.

   VALGRIND_FREELIKE_BLOCK is the partner to VALGRIND_MALLOCLIKE_BLOCK.  For
   Memcheck, it does two things:

   - It records that the block has been deallocated.  This assumes that the
     block was annotated as having been allocated via
     VALGRIND_MALLOCLIKE_BLOCK.  Otherwise, an error will be issued.

   - It marks the block as being unaddressable.

   VALGRIND_FREELIKE_BLOCK should be put immediately after the point where a
   heap block is deallocated.

   In many cases, these two client requests will not be enough to get your
   allocator working well with Memcheck.  More specifically, if your allocator
   writes to freed blocks in any way then a VALGRIND_MAKE_MEM_UNDEFINED call
   will be necessary to mark the memory as addressable just before the zeroing
   occurs, otherwise you&apos;ll get a lot of invalid write errors.  For example,
   you&apos;ll need to do this if your allocator recycles freed blocks, but it
   zeroes them before handing them back out (via VALGRIND_MALLOCLIKE_BLOCK).
   Alternatively, if your allocator reuses freed blocks for allocator-internal
   data structures, VALGRIND_MAKE_MEM_UNDEFINED calls will also be necessary.

   Really, what&apos;s happening is a blurring of the lines between the client
   program and the allocator... after VALGRIND_FREELIKE_BLOCK is called, the
   memory should be considered unaddressable to the client program, but the
   allocator knows more than the rest of the client program and so may be able
   to safely access it.  Extra client requests are necessary for Valgrind to
   understand the distinction between the allocator and the rest of the
   program.

   Note: there is currently no VALGRIND_REALLOCLIKE_BLOCK client request;  it
   has to be emulated with MALLOCLIKE/FREELIKE and memory copying.
