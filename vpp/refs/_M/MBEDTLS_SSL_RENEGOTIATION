 * \def MBEDTLS_SSL_RENEGOTIATION
 *
 * Disable support for TLS renegotiation.
 *
 * The two main uses of renegotiation are (1) refresh keys on long-lived
 * connections and (2) client authentication after the initial handshake.
 * If you don&apos;t need renegotiation, it&apos;s probably better to disable it, since
 * it has been associated with security issues in the past and is easy to
 * misuse/misunderstand.
 *
 * Comment this to disable support for renegotiation.
 *
 * \note   Even if this option is disabled, both client and server are aware
 *         of the Renegotiation Indication Extension (RFC 5746) used to
 *         prevent the SSL renegotiation attack (see RFC 5746 Sect. 1).
 *         (See \c mbedtls_ssl_conf_legacy_renegotiation for the
 *          configuration of this extension).
