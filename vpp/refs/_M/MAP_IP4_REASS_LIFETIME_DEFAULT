 * IP4 reassembly logic:
 * One virtually reassembled flow requires a map_ip4_reass_t structure in order
 * to keep the first-fragment port number and, optionally, cache out of sequence
 * packets.
 * There are up to MAP_IP4_REASS_MAX_REASSEMBLY such structures.
 * When in use, those structures are stored in a hash table of MAP_IP4_REASS_BUCKETS buckets.
 * When a new structure needs to be used, it is allocated from available ones.
 * If there is no structure available, the oldest in use is selected and used if and
 * only if it was first allocated more than MAP_IP4_REASS_LIFETIME seconds ago.
 * In case no structure can be allocated, the fragment is dropped.
