 * \def MBEDTLS_SSL_DTLS_HELLO_VERIFY
 *
 * Enable support for HelloVerifyRequest on DTLS servers.
 *
 * This feature is highly recommended to prevent DTLS servers being used as
 * amplifiers in DoS attacks against other hosts. It should always be enabled
 * unless you know for sure amplification cannot be a problem in the
 * environment in which your server operates.
 *
 * \warning Disabling this can ba a security risk! (see above)
 *
 * Requires: MBEDTLS_SSL_PROTO_DTLS
 *
 * Comment this to disable support for HelloVerifyRequest.
