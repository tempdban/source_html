<doc f='include/linux/ethtool.h' l='865'>/* How rings are layed out when accessing virtual functions or
 * offloaded queues is device specific. To allow users to do flow
 * steering and specify these queues the ring cookie is partitioned
 * into a 32bit queue index with an 8 bit virtual function id.
 * This also leaves the 3bytes for further specifiers. It is possible
 * future devices may support more than 256 virtual functions if
 * devices start supporting PCIe w/ARI. However at the moment I
 * do not know of any devices that support this so I do not reserve
 * space for this at this time. If a future patch consumes the next
 * byte it should be aware of this possiblity.
