 * This function gets a validated credential using a postdated credential from
 * @a ccache.  If @a in_tkt_service is specified, it is parsed (with the realm
 * part ignored) and used as the server principal of the credential;
 * otherwise, the ticket-granting service is used.
 *
 * If successful, the validated credential is placed in @a creds.
