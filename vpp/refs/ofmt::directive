     * This procedure is called to allow the output driver to
     * process its own specific directives. When called, it has the
     * directive word in `directive&apos; and the parameter string in
     * `value&apos;. It is called in both assembly passes, and `pass&apos;
     * will be either 1 or 2.
     *
     * The following values are (currently) possible for
     * directive_result:
     *
     * 0 - DIRR_UNKNOWN		- directive not recognized by backend
     * 1 - DIRR_OK		- directive processed ok
     * 2 - DIRR_ERROR		- backend printed its own error message
     * 3 - DIRR_BADPARAM	- print the generic message
     *				  &quot;invalid parameter to [*] directive&quot;
