 * Global Table of fmask objects
 * The key into this table includes the table&apos;s key and the fmask&apos;s key,
 * so there could be a DB per-table. But it is more efficient
 * at forwarding time to extract the fmask from a single global table
 * which is hot in dcache.
 *
 * The table&apos;s key is part of this DB key, since the fmasks therein build up
 * their forwarding mask based on the routes that resolve through
 * it, so cross polination would be bad.
