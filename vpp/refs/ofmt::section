     * This procedure is called when the source code requests a
     * segment change. It should return the corresponding segment
     * _number_ for the name, or NO_SEG if the name is not a valid
     * segment name.
     *
     * It may also be called with NULL, in which case it is to
     * return the _default_ section number for starting assembly in.
     *
     * It is allowed to modify the string it is given a pointer to.
     *
     * It is also allowed to specify a default instruction size for
     * the segment, by setting `*bits&apos; to 16 or 32. Or, if it
     * doesn&apos;t wish to define a default, it can leave `bits&apos; alone.
