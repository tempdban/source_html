 * Weighted RED (WRED) profile
 *
 * Multiple WRED contexts can share the same WRED profile. Each leaf node with
 * WRED enabled as its congestion management mode has zero or one private WRED
 * context (only one leaf node using it) and/or zero, one or several shared
 * WRED contexts (multiple leaf nodes use the same WRED context). A private
 * WRED context is used to perform congestion management for a single leaf
 * node, while a shared WRED context is used to perform congestion management
 * for a group of leaf nodes.
