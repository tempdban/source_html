 * \brief          This function parses the ServerKeyExchange parameters.
 *
 * \param ctx      The DHM context.
 * \param p        On input, *p must be the start of the input buffer.
 *                 On output, *p is updated to point to the end of the data
 *                 that has been read. On success, this is the first byte
 *                 past the end of the ServerKeyExchange parameters.
 *                 On error, this is the point at which an error has been
 *                 detected, which is usually not useful except to debug
 *                 failures.
 * \param end      The end of the input buffer.
 *
 * \return         \c 0 on success, or an \c MBEDTLS_ERR_DHM_XXX error code
 *                 on failure.
