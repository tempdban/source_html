 * Store the definition of a multi-line macro. This is also used to
 * store the interiors of `%rep...%endrep&apos; blocks, which are
 * effectively self-re-invoking multi-line macros which simply
 * don&apos;t have a name or bother to appear in the hash tables. %rep
 * blocks are signified by having a NULL `name&apos; field.
 *
 * In a MMacro describing a `%rep&apos; block, the `in_progress&apos; field
 * isn&apos;t merely boolean, but gives the number of repeats left to
 * run.
 *
 * The `next&apos; field is used for storing MMacros in hash tables; the
 * `next_active&apos; field is for stacking them on istk entries.
 *
 * When a MMacro is being expanded, `params&apos;, `iline&apos;, `nparam&apos;,
 * `paramlen&apos;, `rotate&apos; and `unique&apos; are local to the invocation.
