 * RTE_FLOW_ITEM_TYPE_VF
 *
 * Matches packets addressed to a virtual function ID of the device.
 *
 * If the underlying device function differs from the one that would
 * normally receive the matched traffic, specifying this item prevents it
 * from reaching that device unless the flow rule contains a VF
 * action. Packets are not duplicated between device instances by default.
 *
 * - Likely to return an error or never match any traffic if this causes a
 *   VF device to match traffic addressed to a different VF.
 * - Can be specified multiple times to match traffic addressed to several
 *   VF IDs.
 * - Can be combined with a PF item to match both PF and VF traffic.
 *
 * A zeroed mask can be used to match any VF ID.
