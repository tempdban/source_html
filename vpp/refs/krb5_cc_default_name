 * Return the name of the default credential cache.
 *
 * @param [in] context          Library context
 *
 * Return a pointer to the default credential cache name for @a context, as
 * determined by a prior call to krb5_cc_set_default_name(), by the KRB5CCNAME
 * environment variable, by the default_ccache_name profile variable, or by the
 * operating system or build-time default value.  The returned value must not
 * be modified or freed by the caller.  The returned value becomes invalid when
 * @a context is destroyed krb5_free_context() or if a subsequent call to
 * krb5_cc_set_default_name() is made on @a context.
 *
 * The default credential cache name is cached in @a context between calls to
 * this function, so if the value of KRB5CCNAME changes in the process
 * environment after the first call to this function on, that change will not
 * be reflected in later calls with the same context.  The caller can invoke
 * krb5_cc_set_default_name() with a NULL value of @a name to clear the cached
 * value and force the default name to be recomputed.
 *
 * @return
 * Name of default credential cache for the current user.
