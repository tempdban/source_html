 * \brief          Initiate an SSL renegotiation on the running connection.
 *                 Client: perform the renegotiation right now.
 *                 Server: request renegotiation, which will be performed
 *                 during the next call to mbedtls_ssl_read() if honored by
 *                 client.
 *
 * \param ssl      SSL context
 *
 * \return         0 if successful, or any mbedtls_ssl_handshake() return
 *                 value.
 *
 * \note           If this function returns something other than 0 or
 *                 MBEDTLS_ERR_SSL_WANT_READ/WRITE, then the ssl context
 *                 becomes unusable, and you should either free it or call
 *                 \c mbedtls_ssl_session_reset() on it before re-using it for
 *                 a new connection; the current connection must be closed.
