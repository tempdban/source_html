<doc f='include/krb5/krb5.h' l='7995'>/**
 * Get the (possibly extended) error message for a code.
 *
 * @param [in] ctx              Library context
 * @param [in] code             Error code
 *
 * The behavior of krb5_get_error_message() is only defined the first time it
 * is called after a failed call to a krb5 function using the same context, and
 * only when the error code passed in is the same as that returned by the krb5
 * function.
 *
 * This function never returns NULL, so its result may be used unconditionally
 * as a C string.
 *
 * The string returned by this function must be freed using
 * krb5_free_error_message()
 *
 * @note Future versions may return the same string for the second
 * and following calls.
