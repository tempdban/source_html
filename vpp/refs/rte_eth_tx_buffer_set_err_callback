 * Configure a callback for buffered packets which cannot be sent
 *
 * Register a specific callback to be called when an attempt is made to send
 * all packets buffered on an ethernet port, but not all packets can
 * successfully be sent. The callback registered here will be called only
 * from calls to rte_eth_tx_buffer() and rte_eth_tx_buffer_flush() APIs.
 * The default callback configured for each queue by default just frees the
 * packets back to the calling mempool. If additional behaviour is required,
 * for example, to count dropped packets, or to retry transmission of packets
 * which cannot be sent, this function should be used to register a suitable
 * callback function to implement the desired behaviour.
 * The example callback &quot;rte_eth_count_unsent_packet_callback()&quot; is also
 * provided as reference.
 *
 * @param buffer
 *   The port identifier of the Ethernet device.
 * @param callback
 *   The function to be used as the callback.
 * @param userdata
 *   Arbitrary parameter to be passed to the callback function
