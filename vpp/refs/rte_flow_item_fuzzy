 * RTE_FLOW_ITEM_TYPE_FUZZY
 *
 * Fuzzy pattern match, expect faster than default.
 *
 * This is for device that support fuzzy match option.
 * Usually a fuzzy match is fast but the cost is accuracy.
 * i.e. Signature Match only match pattern&apos;s hash value, but it is
 * possible two different patterns have the same hash value.
 *
 * Matching accuracy level can be configure by threshold.
 * Driver can divide the range of threshold and map to different
 * accuracy levels that device support.
 *
 * Threshold 0 means perfect match (no fuzziness), while threshold
 * 0xffffffff means fuzziest match.
