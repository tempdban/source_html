 * \brief          Enable / Disable renegotiation support for connection when
 *                 initiated by peer
 *                 (Default: MBEDTLS_SSL_RENEGOTIATION_DISABLED)
 *
 * \warning        It is recommended to always disable renegotation unless you
 *                 know you need it and you know what you&apos;re doing. In the
 *                 past, there have been several issues associated with
 *                 renegotiation or a poor understanding of its properties.
 *
 * \note           Server-side, enabling renegotiation also makes the server
 *                 susceptible to a resource DoS by a malicious client.
 *
 * \param conf    SSL configuration
 * \param renegotiation     Enable or disable (MBEDTLS_SSL_RENEGOTIATION_ENABLED or
 *                                             MBEDTLS_SSL_RENEGOTIATION_DISABLED)
