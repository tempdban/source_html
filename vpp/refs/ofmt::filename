     * This procedure is called before anything else - even before
     * the &quot;init&quot; routine - and is passed the name of the input
     * file from which this output file is being generated. It
     * should return its preferred name for the output file in
     * `outname&apos;, if outname[0] is not &apos;\0&apos;, and do nothing to
     * `outname&apos; otherwise. Since it is called before the driver is
     * properly initialized, it has to be passed its error handler
     * separately.
     *
     * This procedure may also take its own copy of the input file
     * name for use in writing the output file: it is _guaranteed_
     * that it will be called before the &quot;init&quot; routine.
     *
     * The parameter `outname&apos; points to an area of storage
     * guaranteed to be at least FILENAME_MAX in size.
