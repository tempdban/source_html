 * Flow rule attributes.
 *
 * Priorities are set on two levels: per group and per rule within groups.
 *
 * Lower values denote higher priority, the highest priority for both levels
 * is 0, so that a rule with priority 0 in group 8 is always matched after a
 * rule with priority 8 in group 0.
 *
 * Although optional, applications are encouraged to group similar rules as
 * much as possible to fully take advantage of hardware capabilities
 * (e.g. optimized matching) and work around limitations (e.g. a single
 * pattern type possibly allowed in a given group).
 *
 * Group and priority levels are arbitrary and up to the application, they
 * do not need to be contiguous nor start from 0, however the maximum number
 * varies between devices and may be affected by existing flow rules.
 *
 * If a packet is matched by several rules of a given group for a given
 * priority level, the outcome is undefined. It can take any path, may be
 * duplicated or even cause unrecoverable errors.
 *
 * Note that support for more than a single group and priority level is not
 * guaranteed.
 *
 * Flow rules can apply to inbound and/or outbound traffic (ingress/egress).
 *
 * Several pattern items and actions are valid and can be used in both
 * directions. Those valid for only one direction are described as such.
 *
 * At least one direction must be specified.
 *
 * Specifying both directions at once for a given rule is not recommended
 * but may be valid in a few cases (e.g. shared counter).
