 * \brief          Disable or enable support for RC4
 *                 (Default: MBEDTLS_SSL_ARC4_DISABLED)
 *
 * \warning        Use of RC4 in DTLS/TLS has been prohibited by RFC 7465
 *                 for security reasons. Use at your own risk.
 *
 * \note           This function is deprecated and will likely be removed in
 *                 a future version of the library.
 *                 RC4 is disabled by default at compile time and needs to be
 *                 actively enabled for use with legacy systems.
 *
 * \param conf     SSL configuration
 * \param arc4     MBEDTLS_SSL_ARC4_ENABLED or MBEDTLS_SSL_ARC4_DISABLED
