 * @brief Read a password from keyboard input.
 *
 * @param [in]     context      Library context
 * @param [in]     prompt       First user prompt when reading password
 * @param [in]     prompt2      Second user prompt (NULL to prompt only once)
 * @param [out]    return_pwd   Returned password
 * @param [in,out] size_return  On input, maximum size of password; on output,
 *                              size of password read
 *
 * This function reads a password from keyboard input and stores it in @a
 * return_pwd.  @a size_return should be set by the caller to the amount of
 * storage space available in @a return_pwd; on successful return, it will be
 * set to the length of the password read.
 *
 * @a prompt is printed to the terminal, followed by &quot;: &quot;, and then a password
 * is read from the keyboard.
 *
 * If @a prompt2 is NULL, the password is read only once.  Otherwise, @a
 * prompt2 is printed to the terminal and a second password is read.  If the
 * two passwords entered are not identical, KRB5_LIBOS_BADPWDMATCH is returned.
 *
 * Echoing is turned off when the password is read.
 *
 * @retval
 *  0   Success
 * @return
 * Error in reading or verifying the password
 * @return
 * Kerberos error codes
