 * @retval 0 Success
 * @retval -EINVAL Invalid *lcore_id* provided
 * @retval -EALREADY Already stopped core
 * @retval -EBUSY Failed to stop core, as it would cause a service to not
 *          be run, as this is the only core currently running the service.
 *          The application must stop the service first, and then stop the
 *          lcore.
