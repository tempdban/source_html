 * Congestion management (CMAN) mode
 *
 * This is used for controlling the admission of packets into a packet queue or
 * group of packet queues on congestion. On request of writing a new packet
 * into the current queue while the queue is full, the *tail drop* algorithm
 * drops the new packet while leaving the queue unmodified, as opposed to *head
 * drop* algorithm, which drops the packet at the head of the queue (the oldest
 * packet waiting in the queue) and admits the new packet at the tail of the
 * queue.
 *
 * The *Random Early Detection (RED)* algorithm works by proactively dropping
 * more and more input packets as the queue occupancy builds up. When the queue
 * is full or almost full, RED effectively works as *tail drop*. The *Weighted
 * RED* algorithm uses a separate set of RED thresholds for each packet color.
