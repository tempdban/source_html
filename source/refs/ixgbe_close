 * ixgbe_close - Disables a network interface
 * @netdev: network interface device structure
 *
 * Returns 0, this is not allowed to fail
 *
 * The close entry point is called when an interface is de-activated
 * by the OS.  The hardware is still under the drivers control, but
 * needs to be disabled.  A global MAC reset is issued to stop the
 * hardware, and all transmit and receive resources are freed.
