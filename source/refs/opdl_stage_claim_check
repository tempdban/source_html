<doc f='dpdk/drivers/event/opdl/opdl_ring.h' l='338'>/**
 * Before processing a batch of entries, a stage must first claim them to get
 * access. Each entry is checked by the passed check() function and depending
 * on block value, it waits until num_entries are ready or returns immediately.
 * This function is only threadsafe with a different opdl_stage per thread.
 *
 * @param s
 *   The opdl_ring stage to read entries in.
 * @param entries
 *   An array of pointers to entries that will be filled in by this function.
 * @param num_entries
 *   The number of entries to attempt to claim for processing (and the size of
 *   the entries array).
 * @param seq
 *   If not NULL, this is set to the value of the internal stage sequence number
 *   associated with the first entry returned.
 * @param block
 *   If this is true, the function blocks until num_entries ready slots are
 *   available to process. If false, then the function claims as many ready
 *   entries as currently possible.
 * @param check
 *   Pointer to a function called to check entries.
 * @param arg
 *   Opaque data passed to check() function.
 *
 * @return
 *   The number of pointers to ready entries filled in to the entries array.
