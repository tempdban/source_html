 * Buffer structure used to pass the pointer data between cores. This is cache
 * line aligned, but to improve performance and prevent adjacent cache-line
 * prefetches of buffers for other workers, e.g. when worker 1&apos;s buffer is on
 * the next cache line to worker 0, we pad this out to three cache lines.
 * Only 64-bits of the memory is actually used though.
