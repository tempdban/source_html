 * Traffic manager hierarchy commit
 *
 * This function is called during the port initialization phase (before the
 * Ethernet port is started) to freeze the start-up hierarchy.
 *
 * This function typically performs the following steps:
 *    a) It validates the start-up hierarchy that was previously defined for the
 *       current port through successive rte_tm_node_add() invocations;
 *    b) Assuming successful validation, it performs all the necessary port
 *       specific configuration operations to install the specified hierarchy on
 *       the current port, with immediate effect once the port is started.
 *
 * This function fails when the currently configured hierarchy is not supported
 * by the Ethernet port, in which case the user can abort or try out another
 * hierarchy configuration (e.g. a hierarchy with less leaf nodes), which can be
 * build from scratch (when *clear_on_fail* is enabled) or by modifying the
 * existing hierarchy configuration (when *clear_on_fail* is disabled).
 *
 * Note that this function can still fail due to other causes (e.g. not enough
 * memory available in the system, etc), even though the specified hierarchy is
 * supported in principle by the current port.
 *
 * @param[in] port_id
 *   The port identifier of the Ethernet device.
 * @param[in] clear_on_fail
 *   On function call failure, hierarchy is cleared when this parameter is
 *   non-zero and preserved when this parameter is equal to zero.
 * @param[out] error
 *   Error details. Filled in only on error, when not NULL.
 * @return
 *   0 on success, non-zero error code otherwise.
 *
 * @see rte_tm_node_add()
 * @see rte_tm_node_delete()
