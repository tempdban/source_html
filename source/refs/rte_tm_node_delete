 * Traffic manager node delete
 *
 * Delete an existing node. This operation fails when this node currently has
 * at least one user (i.e. child node).
 *
 * When called before rte_tm_hierarchy_commit() invocation, this function is
 * typically used to define the initial start-up hierarchy for the port.
 * Provided that dynamic hierarchy updates are supported by the current port (as
 * advertised in the port capability set), this function can be also called
 * after the rte_tm_hierarchy_commit() invocation.
 *
 * @param[in] port_id
 *   The port identifier of the Ethernet device.
 * @param[in] node_id
 *   Node ID. Needs to be valid.
 * @param[out] error
 *   Error details. Filled in only on error, when not NULL.
 * @return
 *   0 on success, non-zero error code otherwise.
 *
