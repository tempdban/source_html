 * @brief Data path protocol.
 * Actions performed on packets in the data-plane can be described and represented
 * by protocol independent objects, i.e. ADJACENCY, but the spceifics actions
 * required during ADJACENCY processing can be protocol dependent. For example,
 * the adjacency rewrite node performs a ip4 checksum calculation,  ip6 and MPLS
 * do not, all 3 perform a TTL decrement. The VLIB graph nodes are thus protocol
 * dependent, and thus each graph edge/arc is too.
 * When programming a DPO&apos;s next node arc from child to parent it is thus required
 * to know the parent&apos;s data-path protocol so the correct arc index can be used.
