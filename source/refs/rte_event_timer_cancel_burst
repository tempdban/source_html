 * @warning
 * @b EXPERIMENTAL: this API may change without prior notice
 *
 * Cancel a burst of event timers from being scheduled to the event device.
 *
 * @param adapter
 *   A pointer to an event timer adapter structure.
 * @param evtims
 *   Points to an array of objects of type *rte_event_timer* structure
 * @param nb_evtims
 *   Number of event timer instances in the supplied array.
 *
 * @return
 *   The number of successfully canceled event timers. The return value can be
 *   less than the value of the *nb_evtims* parameter. If the return value is
 *   less than *nb_evtims*, the remaining event timers at the end of *evtims*
 *   are not consumed, and the caller has to take care of them, and rte_errno
 *   is set accordingly. Possible errno values include:
 *   - EINVAL Invalid timer adapter identifier
 *   - EAGAIN Specified timer adapter is not running
 *   - EALREADY  A timer was encountered that was already canceled
