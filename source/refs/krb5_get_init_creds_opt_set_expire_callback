 * Set an expiration callback in initial credential options.
 *
 * @param [in] context          Library context
 * @param [in] opt              Options structure
 * @param [in] cb               Callback function
 * @param [in] data             Callback argument
 *
 * Set a callback to receive password and account expiration times.
 *
 * This option only applies to krb5_get_init_creds_password().  @a cb will be
 * invoked if and only if credentials are successfully acquired.  The callback
 * will receive the @a context from the krb5_get_init_creds_password() call and
 * the @a data argument supplied with this API.  The remaining arguments should
 * be interpreted as follows:
 *
 * If @a is_last_req is true, then the KDC reply contained last-req entries
 * which unambiguously indicated the password expiration, account expiration,
 * or both.  (If either value was not present, the corresponding argument will
 * be 0.)  Furthermore, a non-zero @a password_expiration should be taken as a
 * suggestion from the KDC that a warning be displayed.
 *
 * If @a is_last_req is false, then @a account_expiration will be 0 and @a
 * password_expiration will contain the expiration time of either the password
 * or account, or 0 if no expiration time was indicated in the KDC reply.  The
 * callback should independently decide whether to display a password
 * expiration warning.
 *
 * Note that @a cb may be invoked even if credentials are being acquired for
 * the kadmin/changepw service in order to change the password.  It is the
 * caller&apos;s responsibility to avoid displaying a password expiry warning in
 * this case.
 *
 * @warning Setting an expire callback with this API will cause
 * krb5_get_init_creds_password() not to send password expiry warnings to the
 * prompter, as it ordinarily may.
