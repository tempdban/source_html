 * \param level     error level of the debug message
 * \param file      file the error has occurred in
 * \param line      line number the error has occurred in
 * \param text      a name or label for the buffer being dumped. Normally the

 * \param buf       the buffer to be outputted
 * \param len       length of the buffer
 *
