 * \brief          Try to write exactly &apos;len&apos; application data bytes
 *
 * \warning        This function will do partial writes in some cases. If the
 *                 return value is non-negative but less than length, the
 *                 function must be called again with updated arguments:
 *                 buf + ret, len - ret (if ret is the return value) until
 *                 it returns a value equal to the last &apos;len&apos; argument.
 *
 * \param ssl      SSL context
 * \param buf      buffer holding the data
 * \param len      how many bytes must be written
 *
 * \return         the number of bytes actually written (may be less than len),
 *                 or MBEDTLS_ERR_SSL_WANT_WRITE or MBEDTLS_ERR_SSL_WANT_READ,
 *                 or another negative error code.
 *
 * \note           If this function returns something other than a positive
 *                 value or MBEDTLS_ERR_SSL_WANT_READ/WRITE, the ssl context
 *                 becomes unusable, and you should either free it or call
 *                 \c mbedtls_ssl_session_reset() on it before re-using it for
 *                 a new connection; the current connection must be closed.
 *
 * \note           When this function returns MBEDTLS_ERR_SSL_WANT_WRITE/READ,
 *                 it must be called later with the *same* arguments,
 *                 until it returns a positive value. When the function returns
 *                 MBEDTLS_ERR_SSL_WANT_WRITE there may be some partial
 *                 data in the output buffer, however this is not yet sent.
 *
 * \note           If the requested length is greater than the maximum
 *                 fragment length (either the built-in limit or the one set
 *                 or negotiated with the peer), then:
 *                 - with TLS, less bytes than requested are written.
 *                 - with DTLS, MBEDTLS_ERR_SSL_BAD_INPUT_DATA is returned.
 *                 \c mbedtls_ssl_get_max_frag_len() may be used to query the
 *                 active maximum fragment length.
