 * @brief 
 * A representation of a path as described by a route producer.
 * These paramenters will determine the path &apos;type&apos;, of which there are:
 * 1) Attached-next-hop:
 *   a single peer on a link.
 *   It is &apos;attached&apos; because it is in the same sub-net as the router, on a link
 *   directly connected to the route.
 *   It is &apos;next=hop&apos; since the next-hop address of the peer is known.
 * 2) Attached:
 *  the next-hop is not known. but we can ARP for it.
 * 3) Recursive.
 *  The next-hop is known but the interface is not. So to find the adj to use
 *  we must recursively resolve the next-hop.
 * 3) deaggregate (deag)
 *  A further lookup is required.
