 * Traffic manager get number of leaf nodes
 *
 * Each leaf node sits on on top of a TX queue of the current Ethernet port.
 * Therefore, the set of leaf nodes is predefined, their number is always equal
 * to N (where N is the number of TX queues configured for the current port)
 * and their IDs are 0 .. (N-1).
 *
 * @param[in] port_id
 *   The port identifier of the Ethernet device.
 * @param[out] n_leaf_nodes
 *   Number of leaf nodes for the current port.
 * @param[out] error
 *   Error details. Filled in only on error, when not NULL.
 * @return
 *   0 on success, non-zero error code otherwise.
