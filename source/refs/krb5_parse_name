 * Convert a string principal name to a krb5_principal structure.
 *
 * @param [in]  context         Library context
 * @param [in]  name            String representation of a principal name
 * @param [out] principal_out   New principal
 *
 * Convert a string representation of a principal name to a krb5_principal
 * structure.
 *
 * A string representation of a Kerberos name consists of one or more principal
 * name components, separated by slashes, optionally followed by the \@
 * character and a realm name.  If the realm name is not specified, the local
 * realm is used.
 *
 * To use the slash and \@ symbols as part of a component (quoted) instead of
 * using them as a component separator or as a realm prefix), put a backslash
 * (\) character in front of the symbol.  Similarly, newline, tab, backspace,
 * and NULL characters can be included in a component by using @c n, @c t, @c b
 * or @c 0, respectively.
 *
 * @note The realm in a Kerberos @a name cannot contain slash, colon,
 * or NULL characters.
 *
 * Use krb5_free_principal() to free @a principal_out when it is no longer
 * needed.
 *
 * @retval
