 * \brief          Check usage of certificate against keyUsage extension.
 *
 * \param crt      Leaf certificate used.
 * \param usage    Intended usage(s) (eg MBEDTLS_X509_KU_KEY_ENCIPHERMENT
 *                 before using the certificate to perform an RSA key
 *                 exchange).
 *
 * \note           Except for decipherOnly and encipherOnly, a bit set in the
 *                 usage argument means this bit MUST be set in the
 *                 certificate. For decipherOnly and encipherOnly, it means
 *                 that bit MAY be set.
 *
 * \return         0 is these uses of the certificate are allowed,
 *                 MBEDTLS_ERR_X509_BAD_INPUT_DATA if the keyUsage extension
 *                 is present but does not match the usage argument.
 *
 * \note           You should only call this function on leaf certificates, on
 *                 (intermediate) CAs the keyUsage extension is automatically
 *                 checked by \c mbedtls_x509_crt_verify().
