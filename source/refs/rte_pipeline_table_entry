 * Head format for the table entry of any pipeline table. For any given
 * pipeline table, all table entries should have the same size and format. For
 * any given pipeline table, the table entry has to start with a head of this
 * structure, which contains the reserved actions and their associated
 * meta-data, and then optionally continues with user actions and their
 * associated meta-data. As all the currently defined reserved actions are
 * mutually exclusive, only one reserved action can be set per table entry.
