 * ACL Field definition.
 * Each field in the ACL rule has an associate definition.
 * It defines the type of field, its size, its offset in the input buffer,
 * the field index, and the input index.
 * For performance reasons, the inner loop of the search function is unrolled
 * to process four input bytes at a time. This requires the input to be grouped
 * into sets of 4 consecutive bytes. The loop processes the first input byte as
 * part of the setup and then subsequent bytes must be in groups of 4
 * consecutive bytes.
