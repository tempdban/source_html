 * \brief          Set the allowed curves in order of preference.
 *                 (Default: all defined curves.)
 *
 *                 On server: this only affects selection of the ECDHE curve;
 *                 the curves used for ECDH and ECDSA are determined by the
 *                 list of available certificates instead.
 *
 *                 On client: this affects the list of curves offered for any
 *                 use. The server can override our preference order.
 *
 *                 Both sides: limits the set of curves accepted for use in
 *                 ECDHE and in the peer&apos;s end-entity certificate.
 *
 * \note           This has no influence on which curves are allowed inside the
 *                 certificate chains, see \c mbedtls_ssl_conf_cert_profile()
 *                 for that. For the end-entity certificate however, the key
 *                 will be accepted only if it is allowed both by this list
 *                 and by the cert profile.
 *
 * \note           This list should be ordered by decreasing preference
 *                 (preferred curve first).
 *
 * \param conf     SSL configuration
 * \param curves   Ordered list of allowed curves,
 *                 terminated by MBEDTLS_ECP_DP_NONE.
