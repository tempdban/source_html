     * This procedure is called to modify the segment base values
     * returned from the SEG operator. It is given a segment base
     * value (i.e. a segment value with the low bit set), and is
     * required to produce in return a segment value which may be
     * different. It can map segment bases to absolute numbers by
     * means of returning SEG_ABS types.
     *
     * It should return NO_SEG if the segment base cannot be
     * determined; the evaluator (which calls this routine) is
     * responsible for throwing an error condition if that occurs
     * in pass two or in a critical expression.
