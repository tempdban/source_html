 * \brief           Write a built up certificate to a X509 DER structure
 *                  Note: data is written at the end of the buffer! Use the
 *                        return value to determine where you should start
 *                        using the buffer
 *
 * \param ctx       certificate to write away
 * \param buf       buffer to write to
 * \param size      size of the buffer
 * \param f_rng     RNG function (for signature, see note)
 * \param p_rng     RNG parameter
 *
 * \return          length of data written if successful, or a specific
 *                  error code
 *
 * \note            f_rng may be NULL if RSA is used for signature and the
 *                  signature is made offline (otherwise f_rng is desirable
 *                  for countermeasures against timing attacks).
 *                  ECDSA signatures always require a non-NULL f_rng.
