 * Shaper (rate limiter) profile
 *
 * Multiple shaper instances can share the same shaper profile. Each node has
 * zero or one private shaper (only one node using it) and/or zero, one or
 * several shared shapers (multiple nodes use the same shaper instance).
 * A private shaper is used to perform traffic shaping for a single node, while
 * a shared shaper is used to perform traffic shaping for a group of nodes.
 *
 * Single rate shapers use a single token bucket. A single rate shaper can be
 * configured by setting the rate of the committed bucket to zero, which
 * effectively disables this bucket. The peak bucket is used to limit the rate
 * and the burst size for the current shaper.
 *
 * Dual rate shapers use both the committed and the peak token buckets. The
 * rate of the peak bucket has to be bigger than zero, as well as greater than
 * or equal to the rate of the committed bucket.
