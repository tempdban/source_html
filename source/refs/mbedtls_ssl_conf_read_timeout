 * \brief          Set the timeout period for mbedtls_ssl_read()
 *                 (Default: no timeout.)
 *
 * \param conf     SSL configuration context
 * \param timeout  Timeout value in milliseconds.
 *                 Use 0 for no timeout (default).
 *
 * \note           With blocking I/O, this will only work if a non-NULL
 *                 \c f_recv_timeout was set with \c mbedtls_ssl_set_bio().
 *                 With non-blocking I/O, this will only work if timer
 *                 callbacks were set with \c mbedtls_ssl_set_timer_cb().
 *
 * \note           With non-blocking I/O, you may also skip this function
 *                 altogether and handle timeouts at the application layer.
