 * of the event is not necessary to be sequential. Application can change
 * the path of event at runtime. If the flag is not set, then event each event
 * will follow a path from queue 0 to queue 1 to queue 2 etc. If the flag is
 * set, events may be sent to queues in any order. If the flag is not set, the
 * eventdev will return an error when the application enqueues an event for a
 * qid which is not the next in the sequence.
