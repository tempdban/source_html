 * \def MBEDTLS_SSL_SESSION_TICKETS
 *
 * Enable support for RFC 5077 session tickets in SSL.
 * Client-side, provides full support for session tickets (maintainance of a
 * session store remains the responsibility of the application, though).
 * Server-side, you also need to provide callbacks for writing and parsing
 * tickets, including authenticated encryption and key management. Example
 * callbacks are provided by MBEDTLS_SSL_TICKET_C.
 *
 * Comment this macro to disable support for SSL session tickets
