 * \def MBEDTLS_SSL_ALL_ALERT_MESSAGES
 *
 * Enable sending of alert messages in case of encountered errors as per RFC.
 * If you choose not to send the alert messages, mbed TLS can still communicate
 * with other servers, only debugging of failures is harder.
 *
 * The advantage of not sending alert messages, is that no information is given
 * about reasons for failures thus preventing adversaries of gaining intel.
 *
 * Enable sending of all alert messages
