 * \def MBEDTLS_SSL_FALLBACK_SCSV
 *
 * Enable support for FALLBACK_SCSV (draft-ietf-tls-downgrade-scsv-00).
 *
 * For servers, it is recommended to always enable this, unless you support
 * only one version of TLS, or know for sure that none of your clients
 * implements a fallback strategy.
 *
 * For clients, you only need this if you&apos;re using a fallback strategy, which
 * is not recommended in the first place, unless you absolutely need it to
 * interoperate with buggy (version-intolerant) servers.
 *
 * Comment this macro to disable support for FALLBACK_SCSV
