 * Configure TX port sniffing for the physical port associated with the calling
 * function. Only a privileged function may change the port sniffing
 * configuration. A copy of all traffic transmitted through the port may be
 * delivered to a specific queue, or a set of queues with RSS. Note that these
 * packets are delivered with transmit timestamps in the packet prefix, not
 * receive timestamps, so it is likely that the queue(s) will need to be
 * dedicated as TX sniff receivers.
