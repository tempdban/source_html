         * IV data is limited to 16 bytes as follows:
         * 12 bytes is provided by an application -
         *    pre-counter block j0: 4 byte salt (from Security Association)
         *    concatenated with 8 byte Initialization Vector (from IPSec ESP
         *    Payload).
         * 4 byte value 0x00000001 is padded automatically by the library -
         *    there is no need to add these 4 bytes on application side anymore.
