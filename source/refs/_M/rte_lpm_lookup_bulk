 * Lookup multiple IP addresses in an LPM table. This may be implemented as a
 * macro, so the address of the function should not be used.
 *
 * @param lpm
 *   LPM object handle
 * @param ips
 *   Array of IPs to be looked up in the LPM table
 * @param next_hops
 *   Next hop of the most specific rule found for IP (valid on lookup hit only).
 *   This is an array of two byte values. The most significant byte in each
 *   value says whether the lookup was successful (bitmask
 *   RTE_LPM_LOOKUP_SUCCESS is set). The least significant byte is the
 *   actual next hop.
 * @param n
 *   Number of elements in ips (and next_hops) array to lookup. This should be a
 *   compile time constant, and divisible by 8 for best performance.
 *  @return
 *   -EINVAL for incorrect arguments, otherwise 0
