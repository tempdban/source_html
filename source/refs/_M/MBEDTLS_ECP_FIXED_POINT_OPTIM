 * Trade memory for speed on fixed-point multiplication.
 *
 * This speeds up repeated multiplication of the generator (that is, the
 * multiplication in ECDSA signatures, and half of the multiplications in
 * ECDSA verification and ECDHE) by a factor roughly 3 to 4.
 *
 * The cost is increasing EC peak memory usage by a factor roughly 2.
 *
 * Change this value to 0 to reduce peak memory usage.
