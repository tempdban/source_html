 * A packet can be identified by hardware as different flow types. Different
 * NIC hardwares may support different flow types.
 * Basically, the NIC hardware identifies the flow type as deep protocol as
 * possible, and exclusively. For example, if a packet is identified as
 * &apos;RTE_ETH_FLOW_NONFRAG_IPV4_TCP&apos;, it will not be any of other flow types,
 * though it is an actual IPV4 packet.
 * Note that the flow types are used to define RSS offload types in
 * rte_ethdev.h.
