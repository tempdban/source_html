 * Allow SHA-1 in the default TLS configuration for TLS 1.2 handshake
 * signature and ciphersuite selection. Without this build-time option, SHA-1
 * support must be activated explicitly through mbedtls_ssl_conf_sig_hashes.
 * The use of SHA-1 in TLS &lt;= 1.1 and in HMAC-SHA-1 is always allowed by
 * default. At the time of writing, there is no practical attack on the use
 * of SHA-1 in handshake signatures, hence this option is turned on by default
 * to preserve compatibility with existing peers, but the general
 * warning applies nonetheless:
 *
 * \warning   SHA-1 is considered a weak message digest and its use constitutes
 *            a security risk. If possible, we recommend avoiding dependencies
 *            on it, and considering stronger message digests instead.
