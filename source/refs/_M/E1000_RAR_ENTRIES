 * Number of high/low register pairs in the RAR. The RAR (Receive Address
 * Registers) holds the directed and multicast addresses that we monitor.
 * Technically, we have 16 spots.  However, we reserve one of these spots
 * (RAR[15]) for our directed address used by controllers with
 * manageability enabled, allowing us room for 15 multicast addresses.
