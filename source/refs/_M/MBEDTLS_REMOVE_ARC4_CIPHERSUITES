 * \def MBEDTLS_REMOVE_ARC4_CIPHERSUITES
 *
 * Remove RC4 ciphersuites by default in SSL / TLS.
 * This flag removes the ciphersuites based on RC4 from the default list as
 * returned by mbedtls_ssl_list_ciphersuites(). However, it is still possible to
 * enable (some of) them with mbedtls_ssl_conf_ciphersuites() by including them
 * explicitly.
 *
 * Uncomment this macro to remove RC4 ciphersuites by default.
