 * PKINIT responder question
 *
 * The PKINIT responder question is asked when the client needs a password
 * that&apos;s being used to protect key information, and is formatted as a JSON
 * object.  A specific identity&apos;s flags value, if not zero, is the bitwise-OR
 * of one or more of the KRB5_RESPONDER_PKINIT_FLAGS_TOKEN_* flags defined
 * below, and possibly other flags to be added later.  Any resemblance to
 * similarly-named CKF_* values in the PKCS#11 API should not be depended on.
 *
 *  @n {
 *  @n     identity &lt;string&gt; : flags &lt;number&gt;,
 *  @n     ...
 *  @n }
 *
 * The answer to the question MUST be JSON formatted:
 *
 *  @n {
 *  @n     identity &lt;string&gt; : password &lt;string&gt;,
 *  @n     ...
 *  @n }
 *
