 * \def MBEDTLS_SSL_DTLS_CLIENT_PORT_REUSE
 *
 * Enable server-side support for clients that reconnect from the same port.
 *
 * Some clients unexpectedly close the connection and try to reconnect using the
 * same source port. This needs special support from the server to handle the
 * new connection securely, as described in section 4.2.8 of RFC 6347. This
 * flag enables that support.
 *
 * Requires: MBEDTLS_SSL_DTLS_HELLO_VERIFY
 *
 * Comment this to disable support for clients reusing the source port.
