 * The actual expression evaluator function looks like this. When
 * called, it expects the first token of its expression to already
 * be in `*tv&apos;; if it is not, set tv-&gt;t_type to TOKEN_INVALID and
 * it will start by calling the scanner.
 *
 * If a forward reference happens during evaluation, the evaluator
 * must set `*fwref&apos; to true if `fwref&apos; is non-NULL.
 *
 * `critical&apos; is non-zero if the expression may not contain forward
 * references. The evaluator will report its own error if this
 * occurs; if `critical&apos; is 1, the error will be &quot;symbol not
 * defined before use&quot;, whereas if `critical&apos; is 2, the error will
 * be &quot;symbol undefined&quot;.
 *
 * If `critical&apos; has bit 8 set (in addition to its main value: 0x101
 * and 0x102 correspond to 1 and 2) then an extended expression
 * syntax is recognised, in which relational operators such as =, &lt;
 * and &gt;= are accepted, as well as low-precedence logical operators
 * &amp;&amp;, ^^ and ||.
 *
 * If `hints&apos; is non-NULL, it gets filled in with some hints as to
 * the base register in complex effective addresses.
