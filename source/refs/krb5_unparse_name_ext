<doc f='include/krb5/krb5.h' l='3573'>/**
 * Convert krb5_principal structure to string and length.
 *
 * @param [in]     context      Library context
 * @param [in]     principal    Principal
 * @param [in,out] name         String representation of principal name
 * @param [in,out] size         Size of unparsed name
 *
 * This function is similar to krb5_unparse_name(), but allows the use of an
 * existing buffer for the result.  If size is not NULL, then @a name must
 * point to either NULL or an existing buffer of at least the size pointed to
 * by @a size.  The buffer will be allocated or resized if necessary, with the
 * new pointer stored into @a name.  Whether or not the buffer is resized, the
 * necessary space for the result, including null terminator, will be stored
 * into @a size.
 *
 * If size is NULL, this function behaves exactly as krb5_unparse_name().
 *
 * @retval
 * 0 Success
 * @return
 * Kerberos error codes. On failure @a name is set to NULL
