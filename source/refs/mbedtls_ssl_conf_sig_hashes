 * \brief          Set the allowed hashes for signatures during the handshake.
 *                 (Default: all available hashes except MD5.)
 *
 * \note           This only affects which hashes are offered and can be used
 *                 for signatures during the handshake. Hashes for message
 *                 authentication and the TLS PRF are controlled by the
 *                 ciphersuite, see \c mbedtls_ssl_conf_ciphersuites(). Hashes
 *                 used for certificate signature are controlled by the
 *                 verification profile, see \c mbedtls_ssl_conf_cert_profile().
 *
 * \note           This list should be ordered by decreasing preference
 *                 (preferred hash first).
 *
 * \param conf     SSL configuration
 * \param hashes   Ordered list of allowed signature hashes,
 *                 terminated by \c MBEDTLS_MD_NONE.
