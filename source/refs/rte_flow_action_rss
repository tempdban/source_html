 * RTE_FLOW_ACTION_TYPE_RSS
 *
 * Similar to QUEUE, except RSS is additionally performed on packets to
 * spread them among several queues according to the provided parameters.
 *
 * Unlike global RSS settings used by other DPDK APIs, unsetting the
 * @p types field does not disable RSS in a flow rule. Doing so instead
 * requests safe unspecified &quot;best-effort&quot; settings from the underlying PMD,
 * which depending on the flow rule, may result in anything ranging from
 * empty (single queue) to all-inclusive RSS.
 *
 * Note: RSS hash result is stored in the hash.rss mbuf field which overlaps
 * hash.fdir.lo. Since the MARK action sets the hash.fdir.hi field only,
 * both can be requested simultaneously.
