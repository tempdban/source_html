 * @param [out] cache_out       Credential cache handle
 * @param [out] princ_out       Client principal
 *
 * Select a cache within the collection containing credentials most appropriate
 * for use with @a server, according to configured rules and heuristics.
 *
 * Use krb5_cc_close() to release @a cache_out when it is no longer needed.
 * Use krb5_free_principal() to release @a princ_out when it is no longer
 * needed.  Note that @a princ_out is set in some error conditions.
 *
 * @return
 * If an appropriate cache is found, 0 is returned, @a cache_out is set to the
 * selected cache, and @a princ_out is set to the default principal of that
 * cache.
 *
 * If the appropriate client principal can be authoritatively determined but
 * the cache collection contains no credentials for that principal, then
 * KRB5_CC_NOTFOUND is returned, @a cache_out is set to NULL, and @a princ_out
 * is set to the appropriate client principal.
 *
 * If no configured mechanism can determine the appropriate cache or principal,
 * KRB5_CC_NOTFOUND is returned and @a cache_out and @a princ_out are set to
 * NULL.
 *
 * Any other error code indicates a fatal error in the processing of a cache
 * selection mechanism.
