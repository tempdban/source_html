	 * false_positive_rate is only used for vBF, but not used for HT
	 * setsummary.
	 *
	 * For vBF, false_positive_rate is the user-defined false positive rate
	 * given expected number of inserted keys (num_keys). It is used to
	 * calculate the total number of bits for each BF, and the number of
	 * hash values used during lookup and insertion. For details please
	 * refer to vBF implementation and membership library documentation.
	 *
	 * For HT, This parameter is not directly set by users.
	 * HT setsummary&apos;s false positive rate is in the order of:
	 * false_pos = (1/bucket_count)*(1/2^16), since we use 16-bit signature.
	 * This is because two keys needs to map to same bucket and same
	 * signature to have a collision (false positive). bucket_count is equal
	 * to number of entries (num_keys) divided by entry count per bucket
	 * (RTE_MEMBER_BUCKET_ENTRIES). Thus, the false_positive_rate is not
	 * directly set by users for HT mode.
