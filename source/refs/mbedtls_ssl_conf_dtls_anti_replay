 * \brief          Enable or disable anti-replay protection for DTLS.
 *                 (DTLS only, no effect on TLS.)
 *                 Default: enabled.
 *
 * \param conf     SSL configuration
 * \param mode     MBEDTLS_SSL_ANTI_REPLAY_ENABLED or MBEDTLS_SSL_ANTI_REPLAY_DISABLED.
 *
 * \warning        Disabling this is a security risk unless the application
 *                 protocol handles duplicated packets in a safe way. You
 *                 should not disable this without careful consideration.
 *                 However, if your application already detects duplicated
 *                 packets and needs information about them to adjust its
 *                 transmission strategy, then you&apos;ll want to disable this.
