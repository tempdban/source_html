 * \brief          Set server side ServerName TLS extension callback
 *                 (optional, server-side only).
 *
 *                 If set, the ServerName callback is called whenever the
 *                 server receives a ServerName TLS extension from the client
 *                 during a handshake. The ServerName callback has the
 *                 following parameters: (void *parameter, mbedtls_ssl_context *ssl,
 *                 const unsigned char *hostname, size_t len). If a suitable
 *                 certificate is found, the callback must set the
 *                 certificate(s) and key(s) to use with \c
 *                 mbedtls_ssl_set_hs_own_cert() (can be called repeatedly),
 *                 and may optionally adjust the CA and associated CRL with \c
 *                 mbedtls_ssl_set_hs_ca_chain() as well as the client
 *                 authentication mode with \c mbedtls_ssl_set_hs_authmode(),
 *                 then must return 0. If no matching name is found, the
 *                 callback must either set a default cert, or
 *                 return non-zero to abort the handshake at this point.
