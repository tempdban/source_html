 * RTE_FLOW_ITEM_TYPE_PORT
 *
 * Matches packets coming from the specified physical port of the underlying
 * device.
 *
 * The first PORT item overrides the physical port normally associated with
 * the specified DPDK input port (port_id). This item can be provided
 * several times to match additional physical ports.
 *
 * Note that physical ports are not necessarily tied to DPDK input ports
 * (port_id) when those are not under DPDK control. Possible values are
 * specific to each device, they are not necessarily indexed from zero and
 * may not be contiguous.
 *
 * As a device property, the list of allowed values as well as the value
 * associated with a port_id should be retrieved by other means.
 *
 * A zeroed mask can be used to match any port index.
