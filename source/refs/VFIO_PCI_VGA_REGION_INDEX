	 * This includes I/O port ranges 0x3b0 to 0x3bb and 0x3c0 to 0x3df
	 * as well as the MMIO range 0xa0000 to 0xbffff.  Each implemented
	 * range is found at it&apos;s identity mapped offset from the region
	 * offset, for example 0x3b0 is region_info.offset + 0x3b0.  Areas
	 * between described ranges are unimplemented.
