 * Ethernet address:
 * A universally administered address is uniquely assigned to a device by its
 * manufacturer. The first three octets (in transmission order) contain the
 * Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI). The following three (MAC-48 and
 * EUI-48) octets are assigned by that organization with the only constraint
 * of uniqueness.
 * A locally administered address is assigned to a device by a network
 * administrator and does not contain OUIs.
