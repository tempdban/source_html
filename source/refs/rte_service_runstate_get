 * Get the runstate for the service with *id*. See *rte_service_runstate_set*
 * for details of runstates. A service can call this function to ensure that
 * the application has indicated that it will receive CPU cycles. Either a
 * service-core is mapped (default case), or the application has explicitly
 * disabled the check that a service-cores is mapped to the service and takes
 * responsibility to run the service manually using the available function
 * *rte_service_run_iter_on_app_lcore* to do so.

 * @retval 1 Service is running
 * @retval 0 Service is stopped
 * @retval -EINVAL Invalid service id
