 * Reserve a portion of physical memory with specified alignment and
 * boundary.
 *
 * This function reserves some memory with specified alignment and
 * boundary, and returns a pointer to a correctly filled memzone
 * descriptor. If the allocation cannot be done or if the alignment
 * or boundary are not a power of 2, returns NULL.
 * Memory buffer is reserved in a way, that it wouldn&apos;t cross specified
 * boundary. That implies that requested length should be less or equal
 * then boundary.
 *
 * @note Reserving memzones with len set to 0 will only attempt to allocate
 *   memzones from memory that is already available. It will not trigger any
 *   new allocations.
 *
 * @note Reserving IOVA-contiguous memzones with len set to 0 is not currently
 *   supported.
 *
 * @param name
 *   The name of the memzone. If it already exists, the function will
 *   fail and return NULL.
 * @param len
 *   The size of the memory to be reserved. If it
 *   is 0, the biggest contiguous zone will be reserved.
 * @param socket_id
 *   The socket identifier in the case of
 *   NUMA. The value can be SOCKET_ID_ANY if there is no NUMA
 *   constraint for the reserved zone.
 * @param flags
 *   The flags parameter is used to request memzones to be
 *   taken from specifically sized hugepages.
 *   - RTE_MEMZONE_2MB - Reserved from 2MB pages
 *   - RTE_MEMZONE_1GB - Reserved from 1GB pages
 *   - RTE_MEMZONE_16MB - Reserved from 16MB pages
 *   - RTE_MEMZONE_16GB - Reserved from 16GB pages
 *   - RTE_MEMZONE_256KB - Reserved from 256KB pages
 *   - RTE_MEMZONE_256MB - Reserved from 256MB pages
 *   - RTE_MEMZONE_512MB - Reserved from 512MB pages
 *   - RTE_MEMZONE_4GB - Reserved from 4GB pages
 *   - RTE_MEMZONE_SIZE_HINT_ONLY - Allow alternative page size to be used if
 *                                  the requested page size is unavailable.
 *                                  If this flag is not set, the function
 *                                  will return error on an unavailable size
 *                                  request.
 *   - RTE_MEMZONE_IOVA_CONTIG - Ensure reserved memzone is IOVA-contiguous.
 *                               This option should be used when allocating
 *                               memory intended for hardware rings etc.
 * @param align
 *   Alignment for resulting memzone. Must be a power of 2.
 * @param bound
 *   Boundary for resulting memzone. Must be a power of 2 or zero.
 *   Zero value implies no boundary condition.
 * @return
 *   A pointer to a correctly-filled read-only memzone descriptor, or NULL
 *   on error.
 *   On error case, rte_errno will be set appropriately:
 *    - E_RTE_NO_CONFIG - function could not get pointer to rte_config structure
 *    - E_RTE_SECONDARY - function was called from a secondary process instance
 *    - ENOSPC - the maximum number of memzones has already been allocated
 *    - EEXIST - a memzone with the same name already exists
 *    - ENOMEM - no appropriate memory area found in which to create memzone
 *    - EINVAL - invalid parameters
