 * \brief   This function computes an ECDSA signature and writes it to a buffer,
 *          serialized as defined in &lt;em&gt;RFC-4492: Elliptic Curve Cryptography
 *          (ECC) Cipher Suites for Transport Layer Security (TLS)&lt;/em&gt;.
 *
 *          The deterministic version is defined in &lt;em&gt;RFC-6979:
 *          Deterministic Usage of the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) and
 *          Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)&lt;/em&gt;.
 *
 * \warning         It is not thread-safe to use the same context in
 *                  multiple threads.

 *
 * \deprecated      Superseded by mbedtls_ecdsa_write_signature() in 2.0.0
 *
 * \param ctx       The ECDSA context.
 * \param hash      The Message hash.
 * \param hlen      The length of the hash.
 * \param sig       The buffer that holds the signature.
 * \param slen      The length of the signature written.
 * \param md_alg    The MD algorithm used to hash the message.
 *
 * \note            The \p sig buffer must be at least twice as large as the
 *                  size of the curve used, plus 9. For example, 73 Bytes if a
 *                  256-bit curve is used. A buffer length of
 *                  #MBEDTLS_ECDSA_MAX_LEN is always safe.
 *
 * \note            If the bitlength of the message hash is larger than the
 *                  bitlength of the group order, then the hash is truncated as
 *                  defined in &lt;em&gt;Standards for Efficient Cryptography Group
 *                  (SECG): SEC1 Elliptic Curve Cryptography&lt;/em&gt;, section
 *                  4.1.3, step 5.
 *
 * \return          \c 0 on success,
 *                  or an \c MBEDTLS_ERR_ECP_XXX, \c MBEDTLS_ERR_MPI_XXX or
 *                  \c MBEDTLS_ERR_ASN1_XXX error code on failure.
