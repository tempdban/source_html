 * \brief          Set the Pre Shared Key (PSK) and the expected identity name
 *
 * \note           This is mainly useful for clients. Servers will usually
 *                 want to use \c mbedtls_ssl_conf_psk_cb() instead.
 *
 * \note           Currently clients can only register one pre-shared key.
 *                 In other words, the servers&apos; identity hint is ignored.
 *                 Support for setting multiple PSKs on clients and selecting
 *                 one based on the identity hint is not a planned feature but
 *                 feedback is welcomed.
 *
 * \param conf     SSL configuration
 * \param psk      pointer to the pre-shared key
 * \param psk_len  pre-shared key length
 * \param psk_identity      pointer to the pre-shared key identity
 * \param psk_identity_len  identity key length
 *
 * \return         0 if successful or MBEDTLS_ERR_SSL_ALLOC_FAILED
