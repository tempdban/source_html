 * Begin connection closing procedure.
 *
 * If at the end the connection is not in CLOSED state, it is not removed.
 * Instead, we rely on on TCP to advance through state machine to either
 * 1) LAST_ACK (passive close) whereby when the last ACK is received
 * tcp_connection_del is called. This notifies session of the delete and
 * calls cleanup.
 * 2) TIME_WAIT (active close) whereby after 2MSL the 2MSL timer triggers
 * and cleanup is called.
 *
 * N.B. Half-close connections are not supported
