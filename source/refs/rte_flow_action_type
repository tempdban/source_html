 * Action types.
 *
 * Each possible action is represented by a type. Some have associated
 * configuration structures. Several actions combined in a list can be
 * assigned to a flow rule and are performed in order.
 *
 * They fall in three categories:
 *
 * - Actions that modify the fate of matching traffic, for instance by
 *   dropping or assigning it a specific destination.
 *
 * - Actions that modify matching traffic contents or its properties. This
 *   includes adding/removing encapsulation, encryption, compression and
 *   marks.
 *
 * - Actions related to the flow rule itself, such as updating counters or
 *   making it non-terminating.
 *
 * Flow rules being terminating by default, not specifying any action of the
 * fate kind results in undefined behavior. This applies to both ingress and
 * egress.
 *
 * PASSTHRU, when supported, makes a flow rule non-terminating.
