     * is added to the cache.  If this function returns 1, it means that the
     * callback will do a SSL_SESSION_free() when it has finished using it.
     * Otherwise, on 0, it means the callback has finished with it. If
     * remove_session_cb is not null, it will be called when a session-id is
     * removed from the cache.  After the call, OpenSSL will
     * SSL_SESSION_free() it.
