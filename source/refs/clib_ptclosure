 * compute the positive transitive closure

 * Ref:
 * Warshall, Stephen (January 1962). &quot;A theorem on Boolean matrices&quot;.
 * Journal of the ACM 9 (1): 11â€“12.
 *
 * foo[i][j] = 1 means that item i
 * &quot;bears the relation&quot; to item j.
 *
 * For example: &quot;item i must be before item j&quot;
 *
 * You could use a bitmap, but since the algorithm is
 * O(n**3) in the first place, large N is inadvisable...
