 * \brief           Check that a point is a valid public key on this curve
 *
 * \param grp       Curve/group the point should belong to
 * \param pt        Point to check
 *
 * \return          0 if point is a valid public key,
 *                  MBEDTLS_ERR_ECP_INVALID_KEY otherwise.
 *
 * \note            This function only checks the point is non-zero, has valid
 *                  coordinates and lies on the curve, but not that it is
 *                  indeed a multiple of G. This is additional check is more
 *                  expensive, isn&apos;t required by standards, and shouldn&apos;t be
 *                  necessary if the group used has a small cofactor. In
 *                  particular, it is useless for the NIST groups which all
 *                  have a cofactor of 1.
 *
 * \note            Uses bare components rather than an mbedtls_ecp_keypair structure
 *                  in order to ease use with other structures such as
 *                  mbedtls_ecdh_context of mbedtls_ecdsa_context.
