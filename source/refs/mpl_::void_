<doc f='include/boost/mpl/void.hpp' l='25'>//  [JDG Feb-4-2003] made void_ a complete type to allow it to be
//  instantiated so that it can be passed in as an object that can be
//  used to select an overloaded function. Possible use includes signaling
//  a zero arity functor evaluation call.</doc>
