 * When reading, the flag indicates whether or not a certain behavior
 * is enabled/present.  When writing, the flag indicates whether
 * or not the driver should turn on (set) or off (clear) a behavior.
 *
 * Some behaviors may read-only (unconditionally absent or present).
 * If such is the case, return EINVAL in the set-flags operation if the
 * flag differs from the read-only value.
