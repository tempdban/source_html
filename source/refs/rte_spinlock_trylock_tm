 * Try to execute critical section in a hardware memory transaction,
 * if it fails or not available try to take the lock.
 *
 * NOTE: An attempt to perform a HW I/O operation inside a hardware memory
 * transaction always aborts the transaction since the CPU is not able to
 * roll-back should the transaction fail. Therefore, hardware transactional
 * locks are not advised to be used around rte_eth_rx_burst() and
 * rte_eth_tx_burst() calls.
 *
 * @param sl
 *   A pointer to the spinlock.
 * @return
 *   1 if the hardware memory transaction is successfully started
 *   or lock is successfully taken; 0 otherwise.
