 * Add application usage routine callout from the eal_usage() routine.
 *
 * This function allows the application to include its usage message
 * in the EAL system usage message. The routine rte_set_application_usage_hook()
 * needs to be called before the rte_eal_init() routine in the application.
 *
 * This routine is optional for the application and will behave as if the set
 * routine was never called as the default behavior.
 *
 * @param usage_func
 *   The func argument is a function pointer to the application usage routine.
 *   Called function is defined using rte_usage_hook_t typedef, which is of
 *   the form void rte_usage_func(const char * prgname).
 *
 *   Calling this routine with a NULL value will reset the usage hook routine and
 *   return the current value, which could be NULL.
 * @return
 *   - Returns the current value of the rte_application_usage pointer to allow
 *     the caller to daisy chain the usage routines if needing more then one.
